    corpus = ["Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 135) to establish the ``Twenty-First Century Water Commission'' to study and develop recommendations for a comprehensive water strategy to address future water needs, as amended.","Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize May as Water Awareness Month throughout California and the United States of America.As our most precious natural resource, water sustains all life in our planet. From humans and animals to plants and trees, every living organism needs water to live. For this reason, it is important for all Americans to protect and conserve our water from contamination and careless waste.This year marks the 29th anniversary of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate public health by setting high health standards and regulating the nation's public drinking water supply. I salute all government leaders, public water providers such as the Walnut Valley Water District, and the California Water Awareness Campaign for their hard work and tireless leadership in making safe drinking water a priority and Water Awareness Month a reality.In addition, I salute our responsible citizens, urban and agricultural water agencies, and farm bureaus in California who have made exceptional strides to improve water quality and conservation since the state's drought years of 1987-1993. Their significant work and leadership have educated communities throughout California and have set an example to other states to care for the quality of their drinkable and non-drinkable water.Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize Water Awareness Month and the people who work hard to make water safe for our daily consumption.","Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my chairman, Mrs. Napolitano, for the hard work that she has put into all these water bills and for her desire to make sure that areas such as southern California have water for the future.The South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act is a relatively modest yet important step toward meeting the long-term water needs for the West. Water recycling is an approach that more and more communities are tapping to meet local and regional water demand. To address the continued growth of water users, communities are truly maximizing the use of every drop of water.The South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act authorizes two water reclamation projects in the South Orange County portion of my district. South Orange County relies heavily on imported water from sources such as the Colorado River and the Bay Delta in northern California.Water reclamation projects and other steps which reduce demand for imported water benefit all regional water uses. The first project outlined in this legislation is the San Juan Capistrano recycled water system, which would enable the City of San Juan Capistrano to provide recycled water to users throughout the city and its neighboring communities. To meet the local demand, the City has developed a project that includes the construction of a water treatment facility as well as transmission infrastructure.I want to thank the San Juan Capistrano Mayor Sam Allevato and the rest of the city council for their dedication to this important project.The second part of this project is the San Clemente Reclaimed Water Project, which would expand San Clemente's reclaimed water infrastructure by doubling its production capability. When completed, San Clemente's recycled water project will reduce the city's demand of domestic water by 3,300 acre feet of water per year. I applaud San Clemente Mayor Jim Dahl and the entire city council for their entire commitment to water recycling.Again, I want to thank my good friend Grace Napolitano, our chairwoman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, for her leadership and support of my legislation. I know she shares my belief that water recycling is an important tool in addressing growing water needs in the west. Mr. Speaker, I think it is crucial that we recognize and assist communities that are working to reduce their reliance on imported water, and I urge all colleagues to support the South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act.","Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce the Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative, to authorize water recycling projects under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI program. This legislation, which passed the House in the 109th Congress, is an important component of southern California's regional water management.The Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative authorizes $30 million for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District to assist in constructing two water recycling projects. The projects will produce nearly 100,000 acre-feet of new water annually to the area's water supply. This initiative has the support of all member agencies of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, which encompasses 240 square miles in southern California. It also serves a number of cities I represent, including the cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Upland and Montclair.These water agencies are using high quality recycled water in many water intensive applications, like landscape and agricultural irrigation, construction, and industrial cooling. This allows fresh water to be conserved or used for drinking, which reduces our dependence on expensive imported water. In addition, by recycling water which would otherwise be wasted and unavailable, these agencies ensure that we ring the last drop of use out of water before it is ultimately returned to the environment.It is imperative that we continue to approve measures preventing water supply shortages in the Western United States. This recycling initiative will help meet the water needs of the Inland Empire and begin a strategic federal-local partnership to bring a significant amount of new water supply to the region. In fact, the Bureau of Reclamation has already recognized the Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative as one of the most cost effective water reuse projects.The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support of all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies downstream in Orange County. IEUA serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana (through the Fontana Water Company), Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga (through the Cucamonga Valley Water District), and the Monte Vista Water District.I look forward to working closely with the House Resources Committee, and with the new Water and Power Subcommittee Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, who is a cosponsor of this bill and has been a champion of regional water solutions. I am also pleased to have the continued support of my colleagues, Ken Calvert and Gary Miller.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend this Republican Congress for passing sound, safe, commonsense legislation to ensure that America's drinking water is clean and healthy for our loved ones and future generations to enjoy. Safe drinking water is of vital importance to San Diego, where nearly all of our waters is imported from the Colorado River and northern California, crossing many fault lines. Because there is such a limited supply of water, San Diegans do not take their water for granted. San Diegans, like all Americans, want water that is safe to consume.One of my priorities in the 104th Congress is to protect the health and safety of American families. The House's passage Tuesday of the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments (H.R. 3604) sends a clear message to families that Republicans are committed to improving and protecting water quality and the environment. I am proud to support this legislation.By passing this legislation, we give State and local water authorities the resources they need to keep our water safe. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California supports the bill because it will ``enable public water systems to address the highest priority water quality issues first.'' The bill contains a strong community right-to-know provision, requiring public notification within 24 hours when water safety violations occur. It focuses resources, where they will do the most good, on eliminating contaminants that pose the greatest risk to people. Moreover, the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments establishes a State revolving fund to help pubic water systems comply with drinking water standards.This legislation received broad bipartisan support. The Nation's Governors, State and county legislators, local water authorities, and several environmental groups support our safe drinking water bill. A commonsense approach has proven successful in protecting water quality, and we can reach consensus on other environmental issues through this same approach. I am proud to joining my colleagues in the proenvironment Congress in passing H.R. 3604.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative. This bill seeks to authorize $30 million total for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) and the Cucamonga County Water District (CCWD), to assist in constructing two water recycling projects which will add 75,000 acre-feet of new water annually to the area's water supply.Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced a new initiative--Water 2025--Preventing Crisis and Conflict in the West--aimed at preventing chronic water supply problems in the Western United States resulting from drought, growth or other challenges. In addition to the federal strategy, California, more than a year ago, established a special Water Recycling Task Force, managed by the State Water Resources Control Board. The Task Force concluded that by the year 2030, California should develop 1.5 million acre feet of new recycled water.Water supply issues in California and other Western states are of paramount concern, especially in light of ongoing challenges with the Colorado River Quantification Settlement Agreement. In order to meet the water needs of the Inland Empire, and to help alleviate California's overdependence on the Colorado River, I see this legislation as a key federal-local partnership to bring a significant amount of new water supply to the region.The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative includes two projects, the first of which will be constructed by the IEUA and will produce 70,000 acre-feet of new water annually. This project is expected to be fully constructed and on-line by 2008. The second of these projects, to be constructed by the CCWD, will produce an additional 5,000 acre feet of new water annually. This project is expected to be fully constructed and on-line by 2010. Between these two projects, 75,000 acre feet of new water will be produced annually before the end of the decade.I am pleased that the Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project has the support of all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies downstream in Orange County. It is also consistent with regional watershed plans, the California Department of Water Resources water recycling task force, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's comprehensive water study, and the Department of Interior's ``Water 2025'' plan.I also want to recognize the hard work of IEUA and CCWD, which serve the Cities of Rancho Cucamonga, Upland, Montclair, Chino, Chino Hills, Ontario, and Fontana. Their dedication to providing the water needs of the region is commendable, and I urge my colleagues to support the Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project.","Mr. Speaker, the Riverside-Corona Feeder Water Supply Act represents an important investment in the water infrastructure in western Riverside County, California, one of the fastest-growing regions in this country.At a time when water demand continues to grow due to the West's increasing population, traditional water sources have been confronted by a prolonged drought and other environmental challenges. In fact, just last week California water officials turned off the huge pumps that send water to Southern California from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to protect a tiny imperiled fish. While the shutdown is only scheduled to last a week or two, it is a stark reminder that Southern California must continue to reduce its dependence on imported water from the Delta and the Colorado River.The Western Municipal Water District provides water service to western Riverside County and serves a population of more than 600,000 people. The purpose of the Riverside-Corona Feeder water supply project is to capture and store water in wet years in order to increase Western's firm water supplies, provide a cost-effective water supply, and improve water quality.New wet year water will come from local runoff, including regulated releases from Seven Oaks Dam and the State Water Project and stored in San Bernardino groundwater basins. To deliver the stored water to consumers in Western's service area, the project will provide for new groundwater pumping and pipeline capability. As an additional benefit, the Riverside-Corona Feeder will provide the means to control water tables, thereby reducing liquefaction dangers in the Colton and San Bernardino communities. Additionally, the project improves local water quality as perchlorate and other contaminants would be removed from the basin when water is extracted from the well heads via the Riverside-Corona Feeder.I applaud Western and our local elected officials in Western Riverside County for taking bold, proactive steps in meeting our region's current and future water demand. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the leadership of Western's General Manager, John Rossi, as well as the Western board members, Charles Field, Tom Evans, Brenda Dennstedt, Don Galleano, and Al Lopez. I also want to thank my good friend Grace Napolitano, the chairwoman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, for her leadership and support of my legislation.I think it is crucial that we recognize and assist communities that are working to reduce their reliance on imported water, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the Riverside-Corona Feeder Water Supply Act.","Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize water recycling and other water supply projects by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency and the Cucamonga Valley Water District. These projects will produce approximately 95,000 acre-feet of new water annually in one of the most rapidly growing regions in the United States, reducing the need for imported water from the Colorado River and northern California through the California Water Project.The federal investment required is limited to approximately 10 percent of the projects' cost, or about $30 million.This legislation is intended to be the companion to H.R. 122, sponsored by David Dreier, Grace Napolitano, Ken Calvert, Joe Baca, and Gary Miller.This legislation has broad support and has already passed the House, and in fact similar legislation to H.R. 122 also passed the House of Representatives in each of the previous two Congresses.It is time for this legislation to pass the Senate as well and be enacted into law. Environmental groups such as the Mono Lake Committee, Environmental Defense, Clean Water and Natural Resources Defense Council strongly support the water recycling and groundwater remediation projects in this bill. Business leaders such as Southern Cal Edison and Building Industry Association also support these projects.The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative would authorize two project components. The first will be constructed by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency--IEUA--and will produce approximately 90,000 acre feet of new water annually. The second of these projects, to be constructed by the Cucamonga Valley Water District--CVWD--will produce an additional 5,000 acre feet of new water annually.The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support of all member agencies of IEUA, as well as the water agencies downstream in Orange County. IEUA encompasses approximately 242 square miles and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana--through the Fontana Water Company--Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga--through the Cucamonga Valley Water District--and the Monte Vista Water District.I want to say a few words about the importance of water recycling projects.The development of recycled water can bring significant amounts of water ``on line'' in a relatively short period of time. Recycled water provides our State and region with the ability to ``stretch'' existing water supplies significantly and in so doing, minimize conflict and address the many needs that exist. According to the State of California's Recycled Water Task Force, water recycling is a critical part of California's water future with an estimated 1.5 million acre-feet of new supplies being developed over the next 25 years.Water recycling is also a bipartisan initiative in California, as witnessed by the many Republican and Democratic House cosponsors of the House versions of the bill I introduce today.Water recycling also has significant greenhouse gas reduction benefits. The greenhouse gas emission reductions attributed to local development and use of recycled water within Inland Empire Utilities Agency's service area is roughly 100,000 tons of CO equivalents per year.2With only a small percentage of the total recycled water available being used in Southern California, approximately 10 percent, there is a huge potential for additional energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions from aggressive development of recycled water supplies.California is not the only State engaged in water recycling. Today, water recycling is an essential water supply element in Albuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Tucson, EI Paso, San Antonio, Portland, and other western metropolitan areas.I urge my colleagues to support this bill to help meet the West's water supply needs and to reduce our dependence on the Colorado River. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.","Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3897, the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Act. This legislation authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the design and construction of the Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project. This important water bank project will help improve water supply in California's San Joaquin Valley, which includes my congressional district.The Project will be located on the over 13,000-acre Madera Ranch, where the soils are ideal for percolating water from the surface to the aquifer for storage. The land is also a valuable habitat for numerous species and contains large sections of the region's native grasslands.Since I first introduced this legislation in early 2006 the water supply needs of the area have only increased. Court decisions and drought have led to an increasing demand on water supply in California. Groundwater pumping is exceeding groundwater recharge by approximately 100,000 acre-feet per year, causing severe groundwater level declines. This water bank, by storing excess water in wet years, will provide a much needed source of water in dry years and facilitate the restoration of groundwater levels over time.The Madera Irrigation District has worked tirelessly to develop this exciting and innovative project that will increase water supply, provide groundwater resource protection, contribute to habitat conservation and have other positive impacts on the severe water supply and reliability problem in the area.The looming water crisis in California demands more feasible water supply projects, such as this water bank. I am encouraged by the authorization of this project and look forward to many more projects to ensure the water supply and quality in California. Companion legislation has been introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein. Hopefully, with the support of the Senate we will see this project come to fruition.I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to expand water supply opportunities in Madera and California's San Joaquin Valley.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3660. This bill will provide an important piece of proenvironment legislation which will assist our local communities to build and design water reclamation and recycling projects.My district in San Diego County is almost entirely dependent upon imported water for its industrial, residential, and agricultural water supply needs. The majority of the imported water that reaches my congressional district originates in northern California or the Colorado River and is transported through a series of aqueducts and pipelines that cross over the San Andreas earthquake fault. As such, water supply in northern San Diego County is a limited resource that is consistently at risk due to drought, demands elsewhere in the State, and natural disasters.To minimize the potential risks to our water supply, water districts in my congressional district have embarked on a number of water conservation and reuse initiatives designed to reduce demand and provide alternative supplies for nonpotable applications. One of these initiatives is the north San Diego County Area Water Recycling Project. This project is a cooperative effort between the Leucadia County Water District, the San Elijo Joint Powers Authority, the Olivenhain Municipal Water District, and the city of Carlsbad, CA. When completed, the combined production of the two treatment plants will be up to 25 million gallons per day of recycled water. This water can be used for landscaping, golf courses, schools, nurseries, agricultural irrigation and industrial applications.Reclaimed water is an increasingly important element in California's water supply. Regional reclamation projects like this are expected to meet a large portion of California's future water supply needs. Implementation of these projects will reduce the San Diego region's reliance on imported water and produce both economic and environmental benefits for all Californians.I would like to thank the committee and the chairman for bringing this bill forward and ask that my colleagues support H.R. 3660.","Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.H.R. 3897, introduced by myself, authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the study, design, and construction of the Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project. This important water bank project in my congressional district will help improve the water supply in California's San Joaquin Valley.The over-13,000-acre ranch where the water bank is located is well suited for this project. The soils on and underneath the land are ideal for percolating water from the surface to the aquifer for storage. In addition, the land is valuable habitat for numerous species and contains large sections of the region's native grasslands.Funding for this project is under way. Madera Irrigation District, which will operate and maintain this project, issued $37.5 million in bonds to purchase the property. Also, the fiscal year 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations measure allocated $200,000 to conduct a study on the feasibility of the water bank. With increasing demands on its limited water supply, the San Joaquin Valley is falling behind in creating additional water sources. The Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project will enable water users to store excess river flows in a nearby aquifer. This stored water bank would then be used during dry years and could prove critical to meeting demands.I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to expand water supply opportunities in the San Joaquin Valley.Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","Madam Speaker, due to overwhelming response from water users in the Central Valley, I am compelled today to introduce additional letters of support for the Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009. The bill would grant authority to the Bureau of Reclamation to approve voluntary water transfers between sellers and buyers in the San Joaquin Valley and streamline environmental reviews for Central Valley water transfers.The bill is supported by a great number of water users across the Central Valley, including the following: Friant Water Users Authority; San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Authority; Delta-Mendota Canal Authority; Westlands Water District; Metropolitan Water District; Glen Colusa Irrigation District; Northern California Water Association; Banta-Carbona Irrigation District; Tehama-Colusa Canal Authority; Association of California Water Agencies; Placer County Water Agency; Conaway Preservation Group; and Reclamation District 2035.Thank you.Dear Congressman Costa: On behalf of Placer County Water Agency (PCWA), we thank you for introducing legislation authorizing and establishing a programmatic approach to promote and manage water transfers in California. We support your efforts and this legislation as a means of providing greater regulatory certainty for the management of Central Valley Project (CVP) water supplies for water users. As you may be aware, PCWA has participated in water transfers in the past to help meet the needs of water users within the CVP and is intimately aware of the impacts diminished water deliveries cause to farmers and communities. Because of PCWA's experience with previous water transfers, we also would like an opportunity to meet you and your staff to discuss additional regulatory improvements to Reclamation law that would streamline future transfers. Because of below average precipitation and regulatory requirements placed upon the CVP and its water users through the requirements established by the recent National Marine Fisheries Service biological opinions for endangered smelt and salmon, the impact to water users is severe. Your legislation will provide much needed relief in the form of a flexible and useful tool that will allow water to be transferred from willing parties to those in need within the State of California. We look forward to working with you and your staff in the coming months in this important legislative effort, and appreciate your leadership in advancing this legislation and addressing California water issues so important to our collective future. Sincerely,","Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce the California Reclaimed Water Act for the 21st Century. I introduced almost identical legislation in the 106th Congress (H.R. 5555).The dry winter we are experiencing in California should be a reminder that water shortages and drought are quite normal in our State. I strongly believe that investment in reclaimed water technology--water recycling--can help us ``drought-proof'' many of our community water supplies in California.Projects that recycle water result in a net increase in available local water supplies and can decrease the need for water that must be supplied and often imported from other sources. Because wastewater for recycling is available even when other water supplies are diminished, recycled water can assist in providing a long-term, reliable, local source of water even during droughts.Our farmers, urban dwellers, sport and commercial fishing interests, tribes, mountain communities and environmentalists all seek a more reliable and a more certain water future. Recycled water plays an important part in meeting California's water needs today and will play an even more important role in the next several decades.About 3 percent of the water supply in the San Francisco Bay Area is now recycled. Water managers hope that eventually as much as 40 percent of the water will be recycled, perhaps as much as 500,000 acre-feet per year. California cities need planning help and financial assistance to find markets for the recycled water, and to construct the treatment and conveyance facilities needed to get the treated water to identified markets.Recycled water can be used for irrigation of golf courses, parks, school lands, business campuses, and highway medians, and for groundwater recharge, wetlands development; and industrial purposes. We have to start thinking about recycled water as a critical component of the water supply picture in California.Californians and government agencies have recently affirmed their support for water recycling, first with the passage of the California water bond last year, and more recently with the approval of the CALFED water agreement which broadly sets a course for California's water future. Water recycling and reuse is a major element of both these new actions and policies.The Federal government's support for water recycling was initially authorized in the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act of 1992. The Bureau of Reclamation's so-called ``Title XVI'' program originally approved financial assistance for planning, design and construction of four water recycling projects in California. More projects were approved in 1996.The legislation I introduce today builds upon these Congressional efforts, voter ballot initiatives and agency studies.The bill authorizes a series of new Title XVI water recycling projects and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with various water districts throughout the State on water recycling activities. Specific projects included in the bill are: Castaic Lake Water Agency; Clear Lake Basin Water Reuse Project; San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Project; Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project; San Pablo Baylands Water Reuse Project in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Solano Counties; State of California Water Recycling Program; Regional Brine Lines (salt removal) in Southern California and in the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley areas; Lower Chino Dairy Area Desalination Demonstration and Reclamation Project; and the West Basin Comprehensive Desalination Demonstration Program.These projects will have the capacity to produce hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of useable water. Each acre-foot of recycled water produced by these projects will reduce the demand in California for imported water from the Bay-Delta and the Colorado River.Unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation water projects, these water recycling projects require a majority of funds to be locally provided. Consistent with Title XVI limitations on recycling projects as authorized in 1992 and 1996, the projects proposed in my bill require 75 percent local funding. Federal cost sharing is limited to 25 percent. Moreover, this bill specifies that none of the funds can be used for annual operation and maintenance costs. Those annual expenses are the responsibility of the local water districts or management agency.I strongly believe that water recycling will continue to play an important and growing role in total water management strategies to provide a safe and sustainable water supply in California and in many other parts of the country. The water recycling projects authorized by the legislation I am introducing today are part of a long-term solution to some of California's most difficult challenges. Water recycling is not the only solution. But, water recycling and water reuse can play a significant part as these projects can be designed, built, and placed in service within a short time.","Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the California Reclaimed Water Act for the 21st century. As California takes its first steps into the 21st century, it is undeniable that the quality of water, the quantity of water, and the availability of water are among the most formidable challenges to our 34 million citizens and the many diverse regions of our fast growing state. Our farmers, urban dwellers, sport and commercial fishing interests, tribes, mountain communities and environmentalists all seek a more reliable and a more certain water future. Recycled water plays an important part in meeting California's water needs today and will play an even more important role in the next several decades.California is making significant progress in its effort to put its water house in order. Between March and June of this year, two major water policy initiatives occurred in California. On March 7, 2000, California voters overwhelmingly approved a $2 billion water bond. Further, on August 28, 2000, Governor Gray Davis and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt signed the landmark CALFED water agreement which broadly sets a course for California's water future. Water recycling and reuse is a major element of both these new actions and policies.The existing federal program to support water recycling is found in title XVI, Public Law 102-575 and was enacted in 1992. The law authorized recycling projects and studies throughout California, including in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. The law also authorized projects in Colorado and Arizona. The 1992 law also called for a special Southern California Comprehensive Water Reclamation and Reuse study to investigate how the use of recycled water could relieve water supply pressure in California. That study is being prepared by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, State of California's Department of Water Resources, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Central Basin and West Basin Municipal Water Districts, City of Los Angeles, City of San Diego, San Diego Water Authority, Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority and the South Orange County Reclamation Authority. It should soon be completed.Expressing continued support for the title XVI program, in 1996 Congress authorized a second group of water recycling projects in California, from Watsonville to Ventura County, and from Pasadena to Orange County, plus individual projects in Utah, New Mexico, Texas and Nevada. The legislation I introduce today builds upon these congressional efforts, voter ballot initiatives and agency studies. The bill authorizes a series of title XVI water recycling projects and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with various water districts throughout the State including: Castaic Lake Water Agency Reclaimed Water Project Lake County, Clear Lake Basin Water Reuse Project East Bay Municipal Utility District and the San Ramon Serves District Recycled Water Project Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project in San Bernardino County San Pablo Baylands Water Reuse Project in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Solano Counties State of California Water Recycling Program Regional Brine Lines (salt removal) in Southern California, the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley areas Chino Basin Watermaster, Inland Empire Utilities Agency, Western Municipal Water District and the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority for the Lower Chino Dairy Area Desalination Demonstration and Reclamation Project.Additional research, in cooperation with the WateReuse Foundation, is mandated and two previously authorized projects, one in Los Angeles and the other in the San Gabriel Basin, are modified. Finally, my bill mandates that the proposed projects be coordinated with the CALFED Program. Taken together, these projects will have the capacity to produce hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water. The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project, for example, is designed to yield up to 66,000 acre feet of recycled water annually. Each acre foot of recycled water reduces the demand for imported water from the Bay-Delta and the Colorado River. Inland proposed to ``drought proof'' its region with these and related investments.Beneficiaries of these projects and these investments include the immediate service areas, downstream neighbors, and towns and communities throughout California. Water recycling projects in California also reduce the demand for imported water, be it from the San Francisco Bay-Delta or the Colorado River. Recycling and reuse investments in Southern California have the effect of helping the Bay-Delta by reducing demand for additional imported Bay-Delta water. These same investments benefit California's neighboring states up and down the Colorado River. As more water is developed locally, pressure is reduced for imports.Presently, negotiations are underway between California and the other six states of the Colorado River Basin. California is being asked to reduce the amount of water it takes from the Colorado River. In fact, as a result of these talks, California faces a reduction of some 800,000 acre feet. The water recycling projects proposed in this legislation can help California meet this challenge. As a result, Utah, Colorado, Nevada and Arizona also benefit from these programs. Unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation water projects, these water recycling projects require a majority of funds to be locally provided. Consistent with title XVI limitations on recycling projects as authorized in 1992 and 1996, the projects proposed in my bill require 75 percent local funding. Federal cost sharing is limited to 25 percent. Moreover, this bill specifies that none of the funds can be used for annual operation and maintenance costs. Those annual expenses are the responsibility of the local water districts or management agency.The water recycling projects authorized by my bill are part of a long-term solution to some of California's most difficult challenges. Water recycling is not the only solution. But, water recycling and water reuse can play a significant part as these projects can be designed, built, and placed on line within a short time. This bill helps communities throughout California. This bill helps communities in Southern California, reducing pressure on the Bay-Delta water supplies. And, this bill respects our neighboring states up and down the Colorado River. I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be printed in the Record.","Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Senator Barbara Boxer in introducing the California Reclaimed Water Act for the 21st Century.The recent string of wet winters in California should not let us forget that water shortages and drought are quite normal in our State. I strongly believe that investment in reclaimed water technology--water recycling--can help us ``drought-proof'' any of our community water supplies in California.Projects that recycle water result in a net increase in available local water supplies and can decrease the need for water that must be supplied and often imported from other sources. Because wastewater for recycling is available even when other water supplies are diminished, recycled water can assist in providing a long-term, reliable, local source of water even during droughts.Our farmers, urban dwellers, sport and commercial fishing interests, tribes, mountain communities and environmentalists all seek a more reliable and a more certain water future. Recycled water plays an important part in meeting California's water needs today and will play an even more important role in the next several decades.About 3% of the water supply in the San Francisco Bay Area is now recycled. Water managers hope that eventually as much as 40% of the water will be recycled, perhaps as much as 500,000 acre-feet per year. California cities need planning help and financial assistance to find markets for the recycled water, and to construct the treatment and conveyance facilities needed to get the treated water to identified markets.Recycled water can be used for irrigation of golf courses, parks, school lands, business campuses, and highway medians, and for groundwater recharge, wetlands development; and industrial purposes. We have to start thinking about recycled water as a critical component of the water supply picture in California.Californians and government agencies have recently affirmed their support for water recycling, first with the passage of the California water bond last March, and more recently with the approval of the CALFED water agreement which broadly sets a course for California's water future. Water recycling and reuse is a major element of both these new actions and policies.The Federal government's support for water recycling was initially authorized in the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act of 1992. The Bureau of Reclamation's so-called ``Title XVI'' program originally approved financial assistance for planning, design and construction of four water recycling projects in California. More projects were approved in 1996.The legislation I introduce today builds upon these Congressional efforts, voter ballot initiatives and agency studies. Senator Barbara Boxer has today introduced identical legislation in the U.S. Senate.The bill authorizes a series of new Title XVI water recycling projects and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with various water districts throughout the State on water recycling activities. Specific projects included in the bill are: Castaic Lake Water Agency; Clear Lake Basin Water Reuse Project; San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Project; Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project; San Pablo Baylands Water Reuse Project in Sonoma, Napa, Marin and Solano Counties; State of California Water Recycling Program; Regional Brine Lines (salt removal) in Southern California and in the San Francisco Bay and the Santa Clara Valley areas; Lower Chino Dairy Area Desalination Demonstration and Reclamation Project; and the West Basin Comprehensive Desalination Demonstration Program.These projects will have the capacity to produce hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of useable water. Each acre-foot of recycled water produced by these projects will reduce the demand in California for imported water from the Bay-Delta and the Colorado River.Unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation water projects, these water recycling projects require a majority of funds to be locally provided. Consistent with Title XVI limitations on recycling projects as authorized in 1992 and 1996, the projects proposed in my bill require 75% local funding. Federal cost sharing is limited to 25%. Moreover, this bill specifies that none of the funds can be used for annual operation and maintenance costs. Those annual expenses are the responsibility of the local water districts or management agency.I strongly believe that water recycling will continue to play an important and growing role in total water management strategies to provide a safe and sustainable water supply in California and in many other parts of the country. The water recycling projects authorized by the legislation I am introducing today are part of a long-term solution to some of California's most difficult challenges. Water recycling is not the only solution. But, water recycling and water reuse can play a significant part as these projects can be designed, built, and placed in service within a short time.","Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2795) to extend certain contracts between the Bureau of Reclamation and irrigation water contractors in Wyoming and Nebraska that receive water from Glendo Reservoir, as amended.","Mr. Speaker, the South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act is a relatively modest, yet important step towards meeting the long-term water needs for the West.Last week, Federal water managers said that they plan to cut off water, at least temporarily, to thousands of California farms as a result of the drought affecting the State. With the State and Federal reservoirs at their lowest levels since 1992, mandatory water rationing is just around the corner. In the midst of our dramatic economic downturn, the lack of water simply makes a bad economic situation worse. The passage of any legislation that enables communities in the West to be more drought-resistant could not be timelier.The South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act authorizes two water reclamation projects in the south Orange County portion of my district. South Orange County relies heavily on imported water from sources such as the Colorado River and Bay-Delta in northern California. Water reclamation projects, and other steps that reduce demand for imported water, benefit all regional water users.The first project outlined in the legislation is the San Juan Capistrano Recycled Water System, which would enable the city of San Juan Capistrano to provide recycled water to users throughout the city and its neighboring communities. To meet the local demand, the city has developed a project that includes the construction of a water treatment facility as well as transmission infrastructure. I want to thank San Juan Capistrano Mayor Mark Nielsen and the rest of the city council for their dedication to this important project.The second project is the San Clemente Reclaimed Water Project which would expand San Clemente's reclaimed water infrastructure by doubling its production capacity. When completed, San Clemente's Reclaimed Water Project will reduce the city's demand of domestic water by 3,300 acre-feet per year. I applaud San Clemente Mayor Lori Donchak and the entire city council for their continued commitment to water recycling.Mr. Speaker, I think it is crucial that we recognize and assist communities that are working to reduce their reliance on imported water and I urge all of my colleagues to support the South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act.","Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my strong support for H.R. 2522, which is a bill introduced earlier this year that would raise the ceiling on the Federal share of the cost of completing the Calleguas Municipal Water District Recycling Project.I believe most of the country knows about the water shortage plaguing the state of California. In my district, maintaining adequate water supplies has also become increasingly problematic, especially as the traditional sources of imported water have become unreliable. For this reason, I introduced H.R. 2522, which will assist the Calleguas Municipal Water District with the development of new water sources.Specifically, this legislation would authorize an additional $40 million in funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to support the completion of a salinity management pipeline, also known as a brine line. This pipeline will collect salty water generated by desalting facilities and excess recycled water and then transport that water for reuse elsewhere. The result will be both improved water quality and an enhanced supply of local groundwater.The increased use of recycled water will expand the water available for approximately 600,000 of my constituents and, at the same time, reduce dependence on water from the sensitive Bay-Delta ecosystem. In an era of drought and water shortages throughout California, local water districts need to do all they can to reduce their dependence on increasingly scarce supplies of imported water.I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Hastings, along with their staffs, for their assistance with moving this important legislation.","Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that further investing in water recycling is sound public policy. This bill would allow the Bay Area to reuse water. This legislation would not mandate additional water transfers or adversely affect California's Central Valley in any way. H.R. 2442 is a proactive step taken by our delegation to address California's water situation in a positive way.I'd like to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).","Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1025) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of implementing a water supply and conservation project to improve water supply reliability, increase the capacity of water storage, and improve water management efficiency in the Republican River Basin between Harlan County Lake in Nebraska and Milford Lake in Kansas.The Clerk read the title of the bill.","Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3360 because it authorizes phase 1 of the Orange County Water Reclamation Project near my congressional district.I particularly want to thank chairman Doolittle, chairman Hansen, and chairman Young for their support and willingness to include my project in their legislation.Last Congress, I introduced a free-standing bill, H.R. 4987, with Congressmen Cox, Dornan, Packard, and Royce to authorize the entire Orange County Water Reclamation Project.This project is vital to the long-term water supply of Orange County and the environmental health of the Santa Ana River. As you know, the long-term water supply outlook for my constituents in Orange County is bleak. Over the next several years, southern California will lose Colorado River Water to Arizona, and it's doubtful that significant new supplies will come from the north.In short, we have very few water options in southern California. It is critical that we make the most of our existing supplies and recycle water wherever possible.Phase 1 of this project will capture 50,000 acre feet of secondary effluent water per year [AFY] from the county sanitation district, clean it, and then pump the recycled water to parks, industrial water users and the Santa Ana River water recharge basins.Rather than dump the effluent water into the Santa Ana and the Pacific Ocean, we can clean it, use it for parks and industrial purposes, and recharge our ground water basins.When phase 2 and 3 of the project are completed, Orange County will recycle 100,000 acre feet of water per year. That's enough water for 400,000 constituents.This is a win-win project for the environment and water users.Again, let me thank the chairman and the Orange County delegation for their support of my project.The committee has put together a fine bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for its passage.","Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning, to recognize Clair A. Hill, an outstanding leader in the State of California.Mr. Hill has been an active public servant in northern California for 30 years and has served as chairman of the California Water Commission, a director of the California Chamber of Commerce, and an active member of the American Society of Civil Engineers.His dedication to the balanced management of California's water supply was recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in its citizen award to him for outstanding lifelong commitment to the wise use and development of California's water resources.Mr. Speaker, I wish to submit for the Record the following written tribute to Mr. Hill in recognition of his distinguished public service and his extraordinary efforts to improve California water management.Whereas, Clair A. Hill is leaving the California Water Commission after 30 years of public service on this body, his tenure having spanned the terms of seven governors; and Whereas, Mr. Hill began his service on the California Water Commission in 1949, when it was then known as the State Water Resources Board, and has ably served as Vice-Chair and Chair of that body; and Whereas, His interest in, and dedication to, multi-purposed coordinated management of California's water supply was recognized by U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in its Citizen Award to him for ``outstanding lifelong commitment to the wise use and development of California's water resources''; and Whereas, Mr. Hill's history of involvement in water resources management at the statewide level is demonstrated by his long association with the California Water Plan. In 1957, he signed the State Water Resources Board's letter transmitting Department of Water Resources Bulletin 3, the first California water plan. In his most recent term on the California Water Commission, he participated in the Commission public hearing on the latest update of the plan; and Whereas, As fishery issues have increasingly becoming become an important component of water resources management, Mr. ","Mr. Speaker, this year the water districts of my State worked together to create a water planning document to address my State's core water infrastructure needs for decades into the future.This document, released by the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA), is called, ``No Time to Waste: A Blueprint for California's Water.'' It lays out a diverse mix of actions and investments designed to help California meet its water supply needs in the coming decades.The ACWA Blueprint is intended to serve as a roadmap for State and Federal leaders to follow to ensure that California has the water supply system it will need to support people, Jobs and ecosystems in the future.It breaks down into 12 recommendations for each region of the State. These include investments to improve water supplies, water use efficiency, water quality and environmental health. The recommended actions are designed to address short and long-term statewide water needs, complement and build on local efforts, and promote integrated regional water management plans that will play a critical role in California's future.Improve the existing Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta water conveyance system to increase flexibility and enhance water supply, water quality, levee stability and environmental protection in the near term.Evaluate long-term threats to the Delta levee and conveyance system and pursue actions to reduce risks to the state's water supply and the environment.Ensure delivery of adequate Colorado River supplies for Southern California and defend California's rights on the Colorado River.Implement and fund the Sacramento Valley Water Management Program.Develop additional groundwater and surface water storage, including proposed surface storage projects now under study if they are determined to be feasible.Support and fund local efforts to expand recycled water use and implement best management practices for urban and agricultural water use efficiency.Improve the quality of California's drinking water supplies to safeguard public health and enhance water quality for agriculture and the environment.Work with local agencies to overcome constraints to developing seawater and brackish groundwater desalination.Modernize the Federal Endangered Species Act and other laws and regulations to allow water infrastructure projects, water supply and water quality activities to proceed while protecting species and habitats.Expedite the approval process for voluntary water transfers.Clarify and expand the State's role in flood control and promote multi-benefit flood control projects.Support integrated regional water management plans.Mr. Speaker, this document represents the first time California water users have produced something this comprehensive, based around a consensus approach and done under their own initiative. Water will be a central resource challenge confronting economic growth and environmental sustainability in California and the West. As the House Water and Power Subcommittee completes its agenda for 2005 and sets new objectives for 2006, I commend to interested observers ACWA's ``No Time to Waste: A Blueprint for California's Water''.","Madam Speaker, as we return to our districts with the August recess, I want to call attention to the ongoing water supply challenges facing the San Joaquin Valley that I represent.This year, we pushed the administration to use all the flexibility and power within the law to increase pumping to move water to our valley. We pushed to find additional water supplies that were not previously available at contract rates, and we were able to increase the water allocation for farmers in our valley significantly. We also pushed to bring critical water infrastructure projects, like the Intertie that we will have groundbreaking next month.Our efforts have produced more than four times the amount of water we received last year, but our fight for water, for valley jobs, and for our economy is far from over. Unemployment is still unacceptable. This administration and Congress must continue to step up its support for the San Joaquin Valley, as farmers and farm communities need a sustainable water supply to grow the country's fresh fruits and vegetables, our Nation's food supply.That is why it is more important than ever in the next water year for Federal and State agency leaders to use every tool in their water toolbox to ensure that water flows. That means we must work together with our local water agencies.","It does provide a valuable and important tool to stretch the existing water supply and address the critical water issues of our State. I urge strongly a ``yes'' vote and encourage all Members to support this legislation. Water for our Nation is critical for all of our citizens and we, as legislative leaders, have to provide for solutions.","Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 236) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to create a Bureau of Reclamation partnership with the North Bay Water Reuse Authority and other regional partners to achieve objectives relating to water supply, water quality, and environmental restoration, as amended.The Clerk read the title of the bill.","Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 297) to authorize the construction of the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System and to authorize assistance to the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the planning and construction of the water supply system, and for other purposes, as amended.","Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill (S. 1467) to authorize the construction of the Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply system, to authorize assistance to the Fort Peck Rural County Water District, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the planning, design, and construction of the water supply system, and for other purposes, as amended.","Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairmen Oberstar and Johnson and Ranking Members Mica and Baker for their leadership on clean water issues and for their work to bring the legislation we are considering today to the floor. In addition, I would like to thank my colleague and good friend, Mrs. Tauscher, for supporting this legislation with me. Mrs. Tauscher and I have adjoining districts in California, and we have similar water needs.My bill, H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007, is straightforward and helpful legislation that I hope both parties will support.Everyone recognizes the need for clean water. It does not matter whether you live in a city or in the rural, it does not matter what your political persuasion is. We all need clean water. Therefore, it is vitally important to identify new water sources for use in agriculture, industry and for residential consumption.In the past, the State Revolving Loan Funds and Clean Water Act construction grants were available for identifying new water sources. But communities now increasingly depend on those funds just to provide for the maintenance and upkeep of existing water infrastructure, rather than finding new and potentially less expensive water supplies.H.R. 700 will provide $125 million so that local governments can innovate to collect, clean and distribute new sources of water. The Healthy Communities Water Supply Act will encourage municipalities, public and private water agencies and nonprofit organizations to find ways to provide new sources of water.For the small investment of Federal funding provided in this bill, we can spur innovation in water resources and move towards solving the increasingly pressing need to ensure clean water for drinking, for family farms, for businesses and for households.H.R. 700 encourages innovation by funding pilot projects and forward-thinking ideas that lead to practical solutions, which can be applied across the board. This legislation means jobs in local communities by spurring the kind of research that can create new businesses and make our towns and cities more livable at the same time.The constant threat of drought in the Western States, along with the reality of global warming, emphasizes why the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007 is so important. We must begin to investigate alternative water sources now, so that we can make strides in ensuring that we have water that we need in the future.I am hopeful that we can move quickly to pass H.R. 700 and to work with the other body so we can provide water relief for our communities.Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an organization whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community organizations who willingly and make their communities a better place to live and work. Western Municipal Water District is one of these organizations. On Thursday, May 13, 2004, Western Municipal Water District will celebrate 50 years of service.Western Municipal Water District, since its formation on January 19, 1954 and authorization by public vote on January 26, 1954 has fulfilled its founding raison d'etre, to augment the shortage of local water available to local communities with supplemental water imported 242 miles to western Riverside County via Metropolitan Water District's Colorado River Aqueduct.The Western Municipal Water District, recognizing the need for a long-term source of high quality drinking water to sustain domestic needs of a burgeoning population, began importing a second source of high quality water in 1979 from northern California via the State Water Project's 444 mile-long California Aqueduct.The Western Municipal Water District provides vital wastewater services as administrative operator of the West Riverside County Wastewater Authority since 1998, as operator of the Santa Ana Regional Interceptor (SARI) brine line since 1983, and as owner-operator of the March Air Reserve Base treatment facility providing irrigation water to the nation's second largest veteran's cemetery since 1996.The Western Municipal Water District, as a court-appointed watermaster pursuant to the 1969 Stipulated Judgment, has been instrumental in maintaining peace among all parties to water rights and water quality issues in the Santa Ana Watershed.The Western Municipal Water District, as one of the five water agencies comprising Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), has provided exemplary water resource management through implementation of the Santa Ana Watershed Basin Plan in cooperation and integrated planning with its neighbors in the Santa Ana Watershed.Western Municipal Water District, has worked cooperatively and diplomatically to address complex political and regulatory issues impacting water at local, regional, state and national levels, and has invested prudently in efficient drought-proofing ventures such as the Nonpotable Conveyance System, Arlington Desalter and Riverside-Corona Feeder. I would like to express deep appreciation to Western Municipal Water District for profound contributions to the present and future health and prosperity of all communities in Western's 510 square mile service.","Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Expansion Act of 2009, which will reduce demand for limited fresh water supplies by providing recycled water to 6 communities across the Bay Area.It will make 6 additional Bay Area recycled water projects eligible for a 25 percent Federal cost-share, and expand the authorizations for two more, totaling $38,075,000. The activities authorized by the new legislation include installing new piping, storage tanks, and pump stations to convey the recycled water to a number of cities across the Bay Area.These projects collectively will save 2.6 billion gallons per year of regional water supply by providing a new water supply of clean treated wastewater for irrigation and industrial use. It will free up the amount needed to supply 24,225 households in the growing Bay Area region. And to the regional agencies, over 3,500 local green jobs will be supported by this legislation.The adoption of water recycling technology is an invaluable conservation method which will result in 8,000 acre-feet of new and reliable water which will reduce demand on fresh water from the Delta.California is facing phenomenal water supply challenges that are affecting our economy, our communities and our environment.California's water infrastructure is woefully out of date. Drought, population growth, climate variability, ecosystem needs and a broken Delta are making it even more difficult to manage our water system and deliver reliable supplies.And unless we take action to address climate change, we could lose a significant portion of the Sierra snowpack, which stores water for 2/3 of California, by 2100.Increasing the capability for and use of recycled water will help address California's cycles of drought and reduce dependence on water from the troubled Bay-Delta ecosystem.Water recycling projects are already under way in several local Bay Area communities, and have qualified for Federal funding under the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program. This program allows local water managers to treat wastewater and use the clean, recycled water for landscape irrigation and other uses, including at golf courses, schools, city parks and other municipal facilities. Under the new legislation, the six additional Bay Area communities would be allowed to work with the Federal Bureau of Reclamation to use water supplies more efficiently.With the increasing strain on Bay-Delta and other natural resources, it is vital that we look to adopt innovative water recycling technologies which sustain permanent clean water supplies and support existing water resources and local economies.Nine Bay Area congressional representatives in the House put this regional approach together, and I'd like to recognize and thank them for their leadership: George Miller, D-Martinez, Pete Stark, D-Fremont, Ellen Tauscher, D-Concord, Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, Mike Honda, D-San Jose, Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose and Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, worked together to address the Bay Area's water needs.This bill reflects a federal-local partnership and will provide communities in the San Francisco Bay Area with reliable and sustainable water supplies, and be a benchmark for other major American cities.Declining water supplies affects people from all across the United States. Now is the time to invest in new water technologies, such as water recycling, to meet increasing needs. Wastewater recycling is an important part of a multifaceted water supply strategy that also includes surface and groundwater storage, improved conveyance, conservation, and desalination.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.","Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce the Safe Drinking Water for Healthy Communities Act of 2004. This legislation will require the EPA to establish a national primary standard for drinking water for perchlorate--otherwise known as rocket fuel.Perchlorate is a component of rocket fuel--used heavily by the military and its defense contractors. Perchlorate contamination in California is primarily the result of releases from 12 military and defense contractor sites. It disrupts the functioning of the thyroid, resulting in behavior changes and delayed development in children and thyroid tumors in adults. It removes valuable water supplies from service.Today, communities across the country are finding perchlorate in their drinking water, groundwater, irrigation water, and soil. In mid 1997, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California discovered perchlorate in the lower Colorado River. It was traced to a Kerr McGee plant in Henderson Nevada. Releases to Lake Mead and the Lower Colorado River have impacted the drinking water supply of 15 to 20 million people in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, Tribal nations and Mexico. Today more than 120 wells in Los Angeles County have been found to be contaminated with varying levels of perchlorate.In the district I represent the water providers are struggling to handle the plumes of perchlorate, the legacy of Aerojet. The City of Baldwin Park hosts the nation's first perchlorate treatment facility--a necessity in order to maintain the reliability and availability of safe drinking water. My community faces costs over the next 15 years of at least $200 million as the result of perchlorate contamination. Yet there exists no enforceable public health standard to ensure our drinking water is safe.This bill requires the EPA to establish a national primary drinking water standard. Without this, there is no requirement for water to have safe levels of perchlorate and water providers will continue to struggle with guaranteeing long term reliability of safe water sources. Inaction poses an unreasonable risk to both our valuable water supply and our health.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the reauthorization of the Water Desalination Act of 1996, included in H.R. 5460, the Federal Water Project Recreation Act which the House approved today.I am pleased that language from H.R. 4792, the reauthorization of the Water Desalination Act, which I introduced earlier this year has been included in the Federal Water Project Recreation Act. This legislation will continue an authorization of $55 million through 2008 for the Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development program (DWPR). The DWPR program has promoted important research to reduce treatment costs of previously unusable water sources such as brackish groundwater and coastal waters. These projects have proved to be valuable investments in helping to meet our nation's future water needs.Since its inception in 1996, the Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development program has helped fund research in cooperation with 20 universities and institutes of higher learning, 33 local governments, and 59 domestic private sector organizations. In all, nearly 30 states are represented in a broad cooperation of both public and private organizations.Such cooperation has produced impressive results with the partnership's efforts making significant technological advances in the field of water desalination and water purification. Clean water is essential for the health of all Americans. As our population continues to grow and conventional water supplies become over used, we will need to look at new resources such as sea water to supplement our supply.I am pleased that with the reauthorization of the Water Desalination Act of 1996 my colleagues recognize the importance of desalination technology. This is a significant step forward in ensuring a safe and steady water supply for our nation.","Mr. President, together with my good friend and colleague, Senator Barbara Boxer, Chairman of the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, I am pleased to introduce today legislation to help the San Francisco bay area a region with a growing population, limited water resources, and a unique environmental setting, address its critical water needs.The bill, the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Authorization Act of 2007, would help seven bay area communities increase their municipal water supplies through innovative and much-needed water recycling projects.These projects offer significant benefits. For California and the Federal Government such benefits include: the preservation of State and Federal reservoir supplies for higher uses rather than for urban landscape irrigation, particularly in drought years; and, a cost effective, environmentally friendly, implementable solution for increased dry year yield in the sensitive bay-delta region. Regional and local benefits include: the preservation of ever declining water supplies from the Sierra and delta for higher uses; assistance in drought-proofing the region through provision of a sustainable and reliable source of water; and reduction in wastewater discharges to the sensitive bay-delta environment.The Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program is a partnership between 17 local bay area water and wastewater agencies, the California Department of Water Resources and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation that is dedicated to maximizing water recycling throughout the region. The regional approach taken by the bay area project sponsors ensures that projects with the greatest regional, statewide, and national benefits receive the highest priority for implementation.This bill would authorize the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to participate in seven bay area water recycling program projects that are closest to completion. Each community with a project would be eligible to receive 25 percent of the project's construction cost. The total cost of the seven projects is $110 million, but the Federal Government's share is only $27.5 million. State funding is available for these projects.For the most part, the projects are ready to proceed and start delivering their benefits the projects having been repeatedly vetted, both internally at the local level and through the various steps of the Federal review process but Federal funding is needed to make implementation a reality and to allow the many benefits of these projects to be realized.Specifically, the bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to participate in the following bay area water reuse projects: Antioch Recycled Water project--Delta Diablo Sanitation District, city of Antioch; North Coast County Water District Recycled Water project--North Coast County Water District; Mountain View/Moffett Area Water Reuse Project--city of Palo Alto, city of Mountain View: Pittsburg Recycled Water Project-Delta Diablo Sanitation District, city of Pittsburg; Redwood City Recycled Water project--city of Redwood; South Santa Clara County Recycled Water Project-Santa Clara Valley Water District, South County Regional Wastewater Authority; and, South Bay Advanced Recycled Water Treatment Facility--Santa Clara Valley Water District, city of San Jose.These seven projects are estimated to make 12,205 acre-feet of water available annually in the short term, and 37,600 acre-feet annually in the long term, all while reducing demand on the delta and on existing water infrastructure.Congressman George Miller introduced a companion bill, H.R.1526, in the House on March 14, 2007. The bill was cosponsored by other bay area lawmakers, including Representatives Anna Eshoo, Ellen Tauscher, Jerry McNerney, Tom Lantos, Mike Honda; Zoe Lofgren, and Pete Stark.Water recycling offers great potential to States like California that suffer periodic droughts and have limited fresh water supplies. To address these issues, the bill would establish a partnership between the Federal Government and local communities to implement a regional water recycling program in the bay area. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.","Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a noncontroversial bill which will make it much easier for States to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act.Under the Safe Drinking Water Act amendments Congress considered last year, States are required to conduct source water assessments. These source water assessments delineate and assess sources of drinking water within each State. They are an important part of our efforts to protect the public's drinking water.When Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, there was the expectation that States could get their drinking water State revolving funds [DWSRF] up and running within a year. Accordingly, States have had the discretion to use up to 10 percent of their Federal capitalization grants for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 to conduct source water assessments. However, this short timeframe for funding has turned out to be problematic for the States. In fact, some States may not even have grant applications submitted during fiscal year 1997.This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to fix this problem by giving States the discretion to fund source water assessments with their capitalization grants for 1 additional year. This bill would not make any new authorizations. It would place no new requirements on States, nor would it require funds to be spent on source water assessments. This bill simply gives States discretion in how they use funds they have already been granted.When Speaker Gingrich proposed Corrections Day in the last Congress, he said that it should be used only for noncontroversial legislation of a limited scope. I have actively participated in the corrections advisory group for the last 2 years and believe that this proposal is the ideal candidate for the Corrections Day calendar.I have consulted with the Office of Drinking Water at the Environmental Protection Agency who have raised no objections. In fact, there is no known opposition to the bill at all. This bill is supported by the State drinking water administrators, the water supply industry, and the environmental groups.The Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the American Water Works Association, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, the Association of California Water Agencies, Clean Water Action, and the Natural Resources Defense Council all support this bill.Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this noncontroversial bill. Congress should act quickly to send this to the President to become law.","Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me this time.As a cosponsor of H.R. 3077, I want to express my support for this bill on the floor. As we all know, water is a precious commodity in the State of California and particularly in the great Central Valley. I have seen the extra mile that water users in this area have taken to conserve water. This is not enough, however, because their water supply reliability has been significantly reduced and no certainty in supply is on the horizon for California agriculture and urban water users.The Central Valley has a long agricultural history, producing over 250 of California's crops. With its fertile soil, temperate climate, and water supply capabilities, the Central Valley produces 8 percent of the agricultural output in the United States, on less than 1 percent of our Nation's farmland. Valley farmers grow nearly half of the fresh fruits and vegetables grown in the entire Nation.At the same time, the Central Valley is the fastest growing region in the State, placing an ever-increasing demand on its urban water requirements. While agricultural and urban water demands are often in competition with one another, neither can be provided for unless a reliable supply of water is made available. Long-term environmental and habitat restoration needs of the Central Valley ecosystem must also be addressed, squeezing still more water out of a dwindling supply. Currently, under the CVPIA, over one million acre-feet of water is provided for environmental purposes each year.The demands for agricultural, environmental and urban water uses in the great Central Valley are endless. Since water is directly tied to the economy, any disturbance in its supply will almost certainly result in the loss of jobs and agricultural production. By the year 2020, a net loss of 2.3 million acre-feet of water is projected for agricultural use. This is unacceptable and irresponsible. The impact of such a decline would be devastating. Thus, an adequate water supply should and must be secured.For these reasons, I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3077. This measure gives water users the ability to obtain water from the State of California by facilitating water transfers at the San Luis Unit. Currently, the San Luis Act prohibits the State from allowing water to go through the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project. This will be corrected under H.R. 3077 and some of the tremendous strains on water supplies in the State will be alleviated.Again, I support this bill and urge its passage.","Mr Speaker, this water recycling legislation, H.R. 1526, enables local agencies across California's Bay-Delta region to invest in sustainable and reliable new water supplies. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.The Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Authorization Act will provide Federal assistance for an ambitious and forward-thinking regional water recycling program that will reduce demand on the Bay-Delta and drought-proof our regional municipal water supplies.The legislation will assist efforts in Pittsburg, Antioch, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Pacifica, South Santa Clara County, Redwood City, and San Jose.The city of Pittsburg and the Delta Diablo Sanitation District, in my congressional district, have been leading the charge on this effort, investing time, energy, and local funds in developing water recycling projects to help meet regional water needs. Water recycling is good for the environment and for local budgets.In Pittsburg, for example, instead of using fresh water from the Delta, recycled water will be applied to city parks, golf courses, medians, and other green spaces. As the Contra Costa Times wrote about the bill, ``There is no good reason to flush wastewater into rivers, bays, estuaries, and the ocean if it can be treated and used again for other purposes such as irrigating parks and golf courses.''I want to thank Chairman Nick Rahall and Chairwoman Grace Napolitano, and the staff of the Natural Resources Committee and the Subcommiteee on Water and Power, for their assistance in this effort, and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.","Mr. Speaker, today, the Northem California Water Association is celebrating its tenth anniversary. Since 1992, NCWA has provided a strong regional voice on California water policy for Northem California's water suppliers, farmers, and landowners.NCWA is a prominent and well-respected organization in Northern California water issues. The organization represents 70 agricultural water suppliers and individual farmers who rely upon the waters of the American, Feather, Sacramento, and Yuba Rivers, smaller tributaries and groundwater to irrigate over 870,000 acres of Northern California farmland, extending from the Coast Range to the Sierra Nevada foothills, and from Redding to Sacramento.For the past 10 years, NCWA has been a leader in protecting Northern California water rights, developing the Sacramento Valley Water Management Agreement, promoting the construction of new surface water storage in Northern California including Sites Reservoir, protecting Northern California groundwater resources, developing and implementing constructive solutions to Bay-Delta water supply and environmental problems, and developing and constructing fish passage improvements including fish screens and siphons.It has been my great honor and pleasure to represent this region and to work closely with NCWA to protect the region's water supplies. Again, I would like to congratulate NCWA as the organization celebrates 10 years representing Northern California water interests.","Madam Speaker, I just want to remind everyone here that earlier this year several other local water measures were resoundingly approved by the House. They include the South Orange County Recycled Water Enhancement Act, which was in Representative Calvert's district; the Lake Hodges Surface Water Improvement Act in Representative Bilbray's district; the Magna Water District Reuse and Groundwater Recharge Act in Representative Chaffetz' district of Utah; the Calleguas Municipal Water District Recycling project in Representative Gallegly's district; the Hermiston water recycling and reuse project, Representative Walden of Oregon; the Tule River Tribe Water Development Act in Representative Nunes' district.Until it was caught up in partisanship, H.R. 2442 would have followed the same procedure. H.R. 2442 is no different than any of these bills. What is different is politics.I reserve my time.","Madam Speaker, H.R. 2614 is a relatively modest, yet important step towards meeting the long-term water needs for the West. Water recycling is an approach that more and more communities are tapping to meet local and regional water demand. To address the continued growth of water users, communities are truly maximizing the use of every drop of water.H.R. 2614 authorizes Federal participation in conjunction with two water reclamation projects, one located in my congressional district and one located in the 41st Congressional District of California. Both projects are located in the greater Inland Empire, a region heavily dependent on imported sources of water.The City of Corona Water Recycling and Reuse Project will enable the city of Corona to provide recycled water to parks, landscape maintenance districts, schools, landscaped freeway frontages and any other project that does not require potable water. The project will also reduce the need for increased water imports and construction of additional drinking water infrastructure.The project will consist of three reservoirs and two pump stations along with retrofitted user irrigation systems. Additionally, 27 miles of pipelines are needed since recycled water is required to be kept completely separate from drinking water and uses a dedicated system of pipelines. The city plans to retrofit approximately 200 sites including schools, public parks and landscape areas, freeway landscaping, golf courses, and commercial landscaping.The Yucaipa Valley Water Supply Renewal Project will maximize the various water resources in the Yucaipa Valley. The new facility will contain an advanced filtration (reverse osmosis) system and a brine pipeline to remove salinity, contaminants, and organic compounds from the water supply in the Yucaipa Valley. The brine pipeline will extend nearly 20 miles to the existing Santa Ana Regional Interceptor brine pipeline.The completed project will minimize the amount of water imported from northern California, maximize the use of higher quality water, reduce withdrawals from ground water supplies, and provide a long-term, drought-proof water supply. The full project is expected to reduce demands on the California State Water Project by over 4 billion gallons per year, which is a sufficient quantity of water for 27,000 families of four each year.I want to thank the city of Corona and city of Yucaipa for developing innovative, water-saving projects that truly benefit our entire region. I also want to thank my good friend Grace Napolitano, the Chairwoman of the Water and Power Subcommittee, for her leadership and support of my legislation. I know she shares my belief that water recycling is an important tool in addressing growing water needs in the West. Madam Speaker, I think it is crucial that we recognize and assist communities that are working to reduce their reliance on imported water and I urge all colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 2614.","Mr. Speaker, I rise today to re-introduce the Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative, to authorize water recycling projects under the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI program. This legislation, which passed the House in the 108th Congress, is an important component of southern California's regional water management.This Initiative includes two projects, the first of which will be constructed by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency (IEUA) and will produce 90,000 acre feet of new water annually. The second of these projects, to be constructed by the Cucamonga Valley Water District (CVWD), will produce an additional 5,000 acre feet of new water annually. Between these two projects, 95,000 acre feet of new water will be produced annually before the end of the decade.With the recent passage of the CalFed authorization, it is imperative that we continue to approve measures preventing water supply shortages in the Western United States. The Inland Empire region is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation. Reducing our dependence on imported water from the Colorado River and northern California will have significant regional benefits including reduced water shortages, energy savings, improved water quality, and job creation. The passage of the Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative will continue the federal-local partnership to bring a significant amount of new water supply to the region.IEUA produces recycled water for a variety of non-potable purposes, such as landscape irrigation, agricultural irrigation, construction, and industrial cooling. By replacing these water-intensive applications with high-quality recycled water, fresh water can be conserved or used for drinking, thereby reducing the dependence on expensive imported water. In addition, by recycling water which would otherwise be wasted and unavailable, IEUA provides that the water available goes through at least one more cycle of beneficial use before it is ultimately returned to the environment.The Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Initiative has the support of all member agencies of lEUA, as well as the water agencies downstream in Orange County. IEUA encompasses approximately 242 square miles and serves the cities of Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana (through the Fontana Water Company), Ontario, Upland, Montclair, Rancho Cucamonga (through the Cucamonga Valley Water District), and the Monte Vista Water District.I want to thank the House Resources Committee, and Chairman Richard Pombo, for moving this bill to successful passage on the House floor during the last Congress. I look forward to working closely with him again, and with the new Water and Power Subcommittee Chairman George Radanovich. I also want to thank my colleagues, Ken Calvert, Grace Napolitano, Gary Miller, and Joe Baca for cosponsoring the Inland Empire Water Recycling Initiative. And last but certainly not least, I commend the hard work and dedication of Mr. Robert DeLoach, General Manager of the Cucamonga Valley Water District, and Mr. Rich Atwater, CEO and General Manager of the Inland Empire Utilities Agency, who both work tirelessly on behalf of the Inland Empire.","Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3812, introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Resources Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Pombo), authorizes a Federal feasibility study on creating more water storage.Rapid population growth and salt intrusion into the underlying aquifer have prompted officials in San Joaquin County, California, to seek a more dependable and reliable water supply for the region. The study in this legislation will examine ways to capture flood flows from an area river in order to develop 65,000 acre feet of potential water supplies.This water storage study will thoroughly examine all the issues surrounding the development of this new water resource, and expressly protects State water law and current permits and agreements. Above all, this legislation serves as the first step towards the development of much-needed water supplies.I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3597, authored by the gentleman from California (Mr. Doolittle), authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a feasibility study on constructing a water storage project on Alder Creek in El Dorado County in California. The goal of the storage project is to provide water supplies during dry and critically dry years.Like many areas in the western United States, El Dorado County faces constant water supply shortages. In light of drought and growing environment and human needs, many believe more traditional storage is needed. Supporters believe this project, in conjunction with water conservation measures, will augment the local water district's water supply, increase downstream habitat flows, and add hydropower resources. This project is an excellent example of a local agency working to secure safe and dependable water supplies for future generations. I urge adoption of the bill.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Speaker, the primary purpose of H.R. 4079 is to authorize the construction of a temperature control device on Folsom Dam. The dam is located about 20 miles upstream from the city of Sacramento, California on the American River. A temperature control device is needed to allow the diversion of municipal water supplies from a point higher in the water column in the Folsom Reservoir than is now possible with the existing municipal water intakes. By diverting the water high on the water column, cold water can be released into the lower American River for steelhead and fall-run chinook salmon during the critical July through October period of the year when water temperatures tend to reach their annual highs. I would urge an aye vote on this bill.Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.","Mr. Chairman, California is experiencing its worst drought in decades, threatening local drinking water supplies, power generation and California's economy, and relief does not seem to be near at hand.More than three-quarters of the State is in extreme or exceptional drought, and it affects every resident in my home State. It would be wrong to take action today that would help one part of the State but harm another.In its current form, the bill is not clear on how reallocating thousands of acre-feet of water from the San Joaquin River restoration to the State's agricultural sector will affect future water supply. We must think about the long-term impacts of today's water decisions, and my amendment ensures that this bill will not adversely affect any community's water supply or water budget, especially during predicted dry years.It is imperative that we figure out how to ensure sustainable water supplies so that next year or in 5 years or in 20 years, Californians on the farms, in the suburbs or in our cities will still have enough water to drink to pursue their livelihoods.Water is our most precious resource, and we must manage it carefully. The underlying bill does not create more water and will not make it rain. We must make sure that decisions made here in Washington won't hurt everyday Californians.Water decisions in California affect every part of the State, including my district in southern California. Recently, the State Water Project announced a zero allocation for this year. This unprecedented move means that southern California communities, including San Diego, will get no water from the Bay Delta in the northern part of the State.Reallocating and rerouting water will not solve that problem. The real solution is to become resilient in the face of future droughts through improved conservation, expanded storage and increased diversity in our water supplies.San Diego was devastated by drought in the 1970s, and since then, southern California has made necessary investments to better prepare for, respond to and withstand drought. Over several decades, San Diego has reduced its long-term water demand and has invested in increased efficiency.Per capita water use has decreased about 27 percent since 2007, and local cities and water districts are on pace to meet their State-mandated water-efficiency targets for 2020. Total regional consumption of potable water in 2013 was 24 percent lower than in 2007.By raising the San Vicente Dam, the largest dam raise in the Western Hemisphere, and constructing the Olivenhain Dam, San Diego has dramatically increased its storage capability, which will supply adequate storage during dry years. The San Diego County Water Authority and the city of San Diego are national leaders in recycling wastewater and in desalination, turning ocean water into usable potable water.So San Diego has done, and is continuing to do, its part because we have done a good job of conserving, preparing and investing as needed to minimize the coming hardships. A real drought solution should not put any community at risk of losing future water supplies to another region without addressing better measures to conserve and store water.This certainly is not the last drought California will face. We will continue to have water supply challenges, and we need to be continuing to prepare for the future. All users must become more resilient, and any action now should have the foresight to maintain water supplies for dry years that are sure to come.I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to protect communities across California and to promote a long-term vision for protecting our scarce water resources. I reserve the balance of my time.","Mr. Speaker, I have introduced H.R. 917, the South San Diego County Water Reclamation Project of 2011, to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation's participation in Phase I of the South San Diego County Water Reclamation Project.Southern California must reduce dependence on water that is imported from outside the region. The South San Diego County Water Reclamation Project is a comprehensive and coordinated approach by public water agencies to address this need by sustainably using groundwater resources through desalination of brackish water, and recycling of wastewater for non-potable uses.When fully implemented, the Project will reduce dependence on imported water by approximately 18,600 acre-feet (or 4 billion gallons) per year, enough to provide service to about 37,000 households. This will minimize supply and environmental impacts to the region's imported water sources, the Colorado River, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta. This water supply would also mitigate the potential impacts of planned or emergency water supply interruptions.The Project includes the following components:A Regional Concentrate Conveyance Facility would serve existing and future desalting and water reclamation facilities. The proposed Conveyance Facility will facilitate continued and expanded operation of the existing Reynolds Desalination Facility and potentially other facilities that may be developed in the region.An additional groundwater desalination facility in the Otay River Valley.A Recycled Water Membrane Bioreactor Facility to treat wastewater and produce recycled water that will be constructed as part of Phase II of the project.The South San Diego County Water Reclamation Project will highly leverage scarce Federal resources. The maximum Federal share would be 25 percent, so each Federal dollar authorized would be matched by a minimum of three nonfederal dollars. In addition, no Federal funding would be used for the operation or maintenance of these facilities.","Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce the Safe Drinking Water for Healthy Communities Act of 2005. This legislation will require the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a national primary standard for drinking water for perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel used heavily by the military and its defense contractors.Communities across the country are finding perchlorate in their drinking water, groundwater, irrigation water, soil and food. Perchlorate has been linked to disruption of the thyroid, resulting in behavior changes and delayed development in children and thyroid tumors in adults. Today more than 120 wells in Los Angeles County have been found to be contaminated with varying levels of perchlorate and my community alone faces costs of at least $200 million over the next 15 years to manage and contain perchlorate.Perchlorate removes valuable water supplies from service and can contaminate our food supply. Yet there exists no enforceable public health standard to ensure our drinking water is safe and to prevent further contamination. At the current rate the Environmental Protection Agency has stated it could not begin to promulgate a public health standard for perchlorate until 2007, if it chooses to do so. Ultimately it is the responsibility of Congress to make sure that the public can trust its water supply, that water providers have guidance, and that those responsible for contamination know that contaminating the water supply and threatening public health is not acceptable.This bill requires the EPA to establish an enforceable national primary drinking water standard by July, 2007. Without this, there is no requirement for water to have safe levels of perchlorate and water providers will continue to struggle with guaranteeing long term reliability of safe water sources. Inaction poses an unreasonable risk to both our valuable water supply and our health.","Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to fund projects within the Irvine Basin.This bill will authorize up to $19 million in funds in order to cover up to 25 percent of the costs of constructing three water projects in Southern California. Water is an issue of paramount importance in California, and these projects provide innovative examples of ways that we can improve our water quality and increase our water supply.The first project, called the Natural Treatment System, will build a network of wetlands to filter surface water and urban runoff in the San Diego Creek Watershed and Upper Newport Bay. Based on the performance of a single constructed wetland in the area, we expect the Natural Treatment System to filter out 126,000 pounds of nitrogen and 21,000 pounds of phosphorus from the watershed each year and reduce levels of harmful bacteria such as fecal coliform by as much as 26 percent.The second project, the Irvine Desalter, will clean brackish groundwater and provide drinking water for between 40,000 and 50,000 people. By allowing the Irvine Basin to access another water source, the desalter will reduce our dependence on imported water and take considerable pressure off of our other water resources.The final project will construct a regional brine line to dispose of brine directly into the ocean. Like much of California, the Irvine Ranch Water District is a leader in water reclamation and recycling efforts. Buildup of too much salt in the system can hamper these reclamation efforts. The brine line will allow the District to continue its innovative efforts to ensure that water is used more than once while increasing use of brackish water resources.These projects shows us how California and the West can improve our water situation. Projects like these show us the way forward. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.","Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the ``Water-Related Technical Corrections Act of 1997.'' This bill is a noncontroversial bill designed to correct and update certain provisions of law that affect the Bureau of Reclamation, an agency of the Department of the Interior.Perhaps the most substantive policy issue addressed in the bill is the section to amend the Warren Act of 1911. The 1911 Act was passed at a time when Bureau of Reclamation facilities were all single-purpose projects for the delivery of irrigation water. Therefore, the Warren Act authorized moving water surplus to the project's needs and nonproject water through Reclamation facilities only for irrigation purposes.Much has happened in the arid West since 1911. In 1939, Congress enacted legislation to authorize multi-purpose Bureau of Reclamation projects. Today, many Reclamation projects in the West do serve many purposes, including delivery of irrigation and municipal water supplies, hydroelectric power generation, fish and wildlife purposes, recreation and flood control. The Warren Act needs to be updated to enable surplus and nonproject water to be moved through federal facilities for various beneficial purposes.As water supplies in the West tighten, efficient water management is needed. An updated Warren Act can help water managers achieve that goal. In fact, legislation to enable surplus and nonproject water to be moved through Reclamation facilities has already been enacted for certain Reclamation projects in the West, including most projects in California and the Central Utah Project. There are pending requests before the Subcommittee on Water and Power to make this modification for two additional projects. The time has come to deal with this subject in a comprehensive manner, and not continue piece-meal efforts to provide water users, including urban water districts, with the tools they need for effective water management.I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this provision, and the other provisions to clarify provisions of Reclamation law.","Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak against this bill, and here is why. This bill does nothing to create additional water supplies. The water that we have already lost, we can't get that back. What we need to do is look at ways to better manage the water we have and look at ways to better conserve that water.We are ready to do this. We are ready to work with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle as Californians. This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. We can't pit one community against another. You are talking about families.This is a picture of Folsom Lake in my district; 500,000 residents in our community rely on water from Folsom Lake for drinking water.It is not about a little fish. It is about when a child goes to turn on their tap they get clean water coming out of it.This should be under water, and if you want to understand how bad it is, let's look at this picture. This is the wet side of Folsom dam. Where is the water? This bill takes water where it doesn't exist. You can't move water if it doesn't exist.So we stand ready to work with our colleagues in both Houses and across the aisle to look at better ways for us to manage water, better ways for us to predict and forecast weather, if you are going to have a dry season, to protect that water, and better ways to serve all of California's communities.It can't be northern California versus southern California versus central California. It has got to be Californians working together. Let's solve this. Let's work together, and let's create a brighter future for California by managing our water together.",]
