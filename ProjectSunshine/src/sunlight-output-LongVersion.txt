                "Madam Speaker, as we return to our districts with the August recess, I want to call attention to the ongoing water supply challenges facing the San Joaquin Valley that I represent.", 
                "This year, we pushed the administration to use all the flexibility and power within the law to increase pumping to move water to our valley. We pushed to find additional water supplies that were not previously available at contract rates, and we were able to increase the water allocation for farmers in our valley significantly. We also pushed to bring critical water infrastructure projects, like the Intertie that we will have groundbreaking next month.", 
                "Our efforts have produced more than four times the amount of water we received last year, but our fight for water, for valley jobs, and for our economy is far from over. Unemployment is still unacceptable. This administration and Congress must continue to step up its support for the San Joaquin Valley, as farmers and farm communities need a sustainable water supply to grow the country's fresh fruits and vegetables, our Nation's food supply.", 
                "That is why it is more important than ever in the next water year for Federal and State agency leaders to use every tool in their water toolbox to ensure that water flows. That means we must work together with our local water agencies."

                "Mr. Chairman, California is experiencing its worst drought in decades, threatening local drinking water supplies, power generation and California's economy, and relief does not seem to be near at hand.", 
                "More than three-quarters of the State is in extreme or exceptional drought, and it affects every resident in my home State. It would be wrong to take action today that would help one part of the State but harm another.", 
                "In its current form, the bill is not clear on how reallocating thousands of acre-feet of water from the San Joaquin River restoration to the State's agricultural sector will affect future water supply. We must think about the long-term impacts of today's water decisions, and my amendment ensures that this bill will not adversely affect any community's water supply or water budget, especially during predicted dry years.", 
                "It is imperative that we figure out how to ensure sustainable water supplies so that next year or in 5 years or in 20 years, Californians on the farms, in the suburbs or in our cities will still have enough water to drink to pursue their livelihoods.", 
                "Water is our most precious resource, and we must manage it carefully. The underlying bill does not create more water and will not make it rain. We must make sure that decisions made here in Washington won't hurt everyday Californians.", 
                "Water decisions in California affect every part of the State, including my district in southern California. Recently, the State Water Project announced a zero allocation for this year. This unprecedented move means that southern California communities, including San Diego, will get no water from the Bay Delta in the northern part of the State.", 
                "Reallocating and rerouting water will not solve that problem. The real solution is to become resilient in the face of future droughts through improved conservation, expanded storage and increased diversity in our water supplies.", 
                "San Diego was devastated by drought in the 1970s, and since then, southern California has made necessary investments to better prepare for, respond to and withstand drought. Over several decades, San Diego has reduced its long-term water demand and has invested in increased efficiency.", 
                "Per capita water use has decreased about 27 percent since 2007, and local cities and water districts are on pace to meet their State-mandated water-efficiency targets for 2020. Total regional consumption of potable water in 2013 was 24 percent lower than in 2007.", 
                "By raising the San Vicente Dam, the largest dam raise in the Western Hemisphere, and constructing the Olivenhain Dam, San Diego has dramatically increased its storage capability, which will supply adequate storage during dry years. The San Diego County Water Authority and the city of San Diego are national leaders in recycling wastewater and in desalination, turning ocean water into usable potable water.", 
                "So San Diego has done, and is continuing to do, its part because we have done a good job of conserving, preparing and investing as needed to minimize the coming hardships. A real drought solution should not put any community at risk of losing future water supplies to another region without addressing better measures to conserve and store water.", 
                "This certainly is not the last drought California will face. We will continue to have water supply challenges, and we need to be continuing to prepare for the future. All users must become more resilient, and any action now should have the foresight to maintain water supplies for dry years that are sure to come.", 
                "I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to protect communities across California and to promote a long-term vision for protecting our scarce water resources. I reserve the balance of my time."

This will minimize supply and environmental impacts to the region's imported water sources, the Colorado River, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta.

                "The Association of California Water Agencies, ACWA, was established in 1910 after five irrigation districts united as one voice to lay the groundwork for developing California's water supply and delivery system. The Association represents the interests of its members at the State and Federal levels, and assists them in promoting the development, management, and use of quality water in an environmentally balanced and cost-effective manner. Since its inception, the work of the ACWA has been reflected in scores of local, regional and statewide water projects.",

In 1991, the ACWA expanded its offices to the District of Columbia to advocate for California water communities on Federal issues. Since that time, the ACWA has participated in efforts that led to enactment of the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996; efforts to keep MTBE out of drinking water; efforts leading to the issuance of the CALFED Record of Decision; efforts to derail a Federal chlorate cleanup exemption and produced ``No Time to Waste: A Blueprint for California's Water Future'' for the California congressional delegation, among other achievements.", 
                "The Association of California Water Agencies has been a guiding force in California's water policy for the past century, and they continue to help shape the laws, policies and regulations that affect the State's urban and agricultural water users. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Association of California Water Agencies for their advocacy and leadership on California water issues, and commending them for the role they have played in developing the State's water policies and regulations.

After graduating with honors in Civil Engineering from the University of Southern California, Hubert served honorably in the United States Army for two years. Hubert joined Albert A. Webb Associates in 1955 and served for 56 years, becoming President in 1984 and Chairman of the Board in 2000.",

He was instrumental in designing 36,500 feet of pipeline and three pump stations to deliver water from the Riverside and Gage Canals to Western Municipal Water District's agricultural system. Hubert also served as the Chief Technical Advisor for the Riverside/Corona Feeder Project which stored water in wet years in the San Bernardino Valley ground water basins and delivered water during dry years to communities in Riverside County.", 
                "As a Professional Engineer in the State of California, he was active in the American Society of Civil Engineers, California Society of Professional Engineers, American Water Works Association, National Ground Water Association, California Water Environment Federation, Federal Water Environment Federation, and National Society of Professional Engineers. In 2008, Hubert was recognized as a Water Hero Award recipient for his donation of valuable and historical water resource documents from the library of Albert A. Webb Associates to the Water Resources Institute's archives.",

He is survived by his daughter Sandra Webb (Roger Prend); sons, Scott Webb and Steve Webb (Suzanne Anderson); sister Mary Webb (Gene Schaefer); 8 grandchildren; companion Diana Lingren, his nephew Matt and many other nieces and nephews.",

Hubert will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Hubert's family and friends; although Hubert may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten. "

                "Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians Water Rights Settlement Act. This legislation will implement a settlement concerning the water rights of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, who have been engaged for several decades in a struggle for recognition and protection of their federally reserved groundwater rights.", 
                "Since 1951, the Pechanga have been involved in litigation initiated by the U.S. concerning water rights in the Santa Margarita watershed. The Pechanga's interest has been in protecting their groundwater supplies, which are shared with municipal developments in the San Diego region. Beginning in 2006, the Pechanga worked with local water districts to negotiate a cooperative solution and put an end to their dispute.", 
                "The Pechanga Settlement Agreement is a comprehensive agreement negotiated among the Pechanga, the U.S. on their behalf, and several California water districts, including the Rancho California Water District and Eastern Municipal Water District. The settlement recognizes the Pechanga's tribal water right to 4994 acre-feet of water per year and outlines a series of measures to guarantee this amount. It is a win-win solution that protects the rights of the Pechanga while ensuring that other communities in Southern California will also have sufficient water supplies.", 
                "I am pleased to be joined by Senator Feinstein in introducing this legislation. We have worked with our colleagues in the House, including Representatives Bono Mack, Grijalva, Richardson, Calvert, Baca, and Issa, to craft this legislation. Our bill not only provides the Pechanga with long-overdue assurances of their water rights, but also exemplifies all the good that can be accomplished when parties put aside their differences and come to the table to negotiate a reasonable solution."

If you support throwing more stored water out to the ocean and making this crisis worse, then this amendment is another step toward that end.",

This program brings together three counties and ten water and sanitation agencies to address water supply shortages by working to develop recycled water as a new water supply source. When fully implemented, the North Bay Water Reuse Program will produce 33,000 acre-feet of recycled water per year in order to maximize the water supply in the North Bay.",

Ms. Webber's leadership in environmental management and water reuse is greatly appreciated and will certainly be missed. Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate at this time that we honor and thank Ms. Webber for her public service and wish her a most enjoyable retirement."

                "Mr. Speaker, we need to think in a comprehensive way about water in California. The controversial California Water Fix, formerly known as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP), is an outdated and destructive plumbing system. It does not create any new water nor does it provide the water and the ecological protection that the Golden State must have. California and the federal government must set aside this big, expensive, destructive plumbing plan and immediately move forward with a comprehensive approach that includes:", 
                "1) Conservation,", 
                "2) Recycling,", 
                "3) The creation of new storage systems,", 
                "4) Fix the Delta--right sized conveyance, levee improvements, and habitat restoration,", 
                "5) Science driven process,", 
                "6) Protection of existing water rights.", 
                "This combination of projects constitutes a comprehensive water plan for the state.", 
                "Through a comprehensive plan that brings all stakeholders to the table, California can solve its water needs, and it can avoid the continuous water wars that have long divided our state. Unfortunately, California is once again embroiled in a bitter water war brought about by the California Water Fix (BDCP), the most recent attempt to fix California's water supply. After more than five years of study and over $200,000,000 spent on consultants, the process has become bogged down and turned into another battle pitting north vs. south, water exporters vs. environmentalists, and senior water right holders vs. new comers. A classic California water brawl is in full bloom.", 
                "The governor's water plan for California is to take water out of the Sacramento River just south of Sacramento and put it into two tunnels each 40 miles long, 40 feet in diameter and with a potential capacity of moving 15,000 cubic feet per second (cfs). While the current proposal is set up to move 9000 cfs, the twin tunnels have a much larger capacity therefore setting the system up for future expansion. Pumping would also continue directly from the southern Delta at the Tracy pumps. The system will be able to deliver up to 5.3 million acre feet of water to the pumps in Tracy and then on to the San Joaquin Valley farmers and Los Angeles.", 
                "So what is wrong with the Water Fix (BDCP)? It is not a water plan for California. It does not create one gallon of new water. It does not solve the long term needs of the state. With a minimum estimated construction and operating cost over 50 years of $24.5 billion, it is an extraordinarily expensive plumbing system dressed up with a coating of habitat restoration. The plan simply takes water from one region and delivers it to another while tearing up acres of prime agricultural farm land in the process. All of this while stoking the fire of divisiveness over water that has plagued our state for years.", 
                "A quick look at the water flow in the Sacramento River over the last two decades shows that approximately six months out of the year there is somewhere between 15 and 20 thousand cubic feet per second (cfs) of water flowing in the Sacramento River. This proposal has the potential to suck the river dry and destroy the largest delta estuary on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere. Critical habitat for dozens of fish species like salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon would be threatened. These fish and the water they live in are crucial for jobs, agriculture and fishing businesses, and the region's economy.", 
                "We should never build a water system that has such destructive potential. It is never safe to assume that ecological concerns will trump greed and thirst. We should keep in mind that in 2012 the U.S. House of Representatives voted on H.R. 1837, the euphemistically titled Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Reliability Act. The bill passed by a vote of 246 to 175 and swept away all environmental protections for the Delta while stealing 800,000 acre feet of water from the aquatic environment. Luckily, the legislation was derailed in the U.S. Senate, but H.R. 1837 in one form or another is likely to return in future legislative battles.", 
                "California must move beyond a patched plumbing system. We need to think about what California really needs, and what it needs is a comprehensive water plan. Big changes are coming that threaten our water supply and our economy. A short list of these challenges include: climate change and related weather events, population growth, world food supplies, and earthquakes.", 
                "Climate change is real and its effect on California will be significant. The Colorado River Basin is in a prolonged drought, and likely to be much drier in the future. Based on today's water flows, the water in the Colorado River is oversubscribed by a third and projections indicate less water in the future. This is a big, big problem for the seven states that rely on the river, and especially for Southern California.", 
                "The Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Central Valley, and the coastal ranges will also be drastically impacted by climate change. We know that the timing of the precipitation is going to change and the snow is already melting earlier. As a result, the snowpack is moving up the mountains and while it may be deeper at the higher altitudes, the amount of land it covers is greatly reduced. It's the lower snowpack that has the greatest volumes of water and if that continues to recede, we will have less and less water. The 2009 ``California Water Plan,'' published by the California Department of Water Resources, estimates that the snowpack will decrease 25-40 percent by 2050. We must also anticipate more severe storms and flooding. All of this means the natural and man-made storage systems will hold less water. Putting the denial of scientific facts aside, California has to deal with the reality of climate change and its water policy implications.", 
                "We know California's population will continue to grow and therefore, the demand for water will increase. We know the world will be very hungry in the future, and we know that the role of agriculture in California is going to be exceedingly important. California agriculture not only fills our own desire for diverse and nutritious foods, but it will also continue to meet basic food needs for people around the world and will continue to serve as an essential component of our nation's economy.", 
                "We know the Delta is in serious trouble. The fish species are threatened with extinction and a total collapse of the estuary ecosystem is possible if the current water pumping program continues. Rising sea levels and deferred maintenance threaten the Delta levees which protect nearly 500,000 people, thousands of acres of valuable farm land, and miles of critical highways, gas and water transmission lines, and water delivery channels. Major upgrades are needed.", 
                "For these reasons, California must take off its blinders and expand its scope when thinking about ways to manage its water supply. It must be a holistic approach that is applied to every project that will impact the water needs of all Californians.", 
                "To achieve this comprehensive approach, here are six specific actions to provide a foundation for California's water future. If California does all of these, we will create new water supplies and better use the resources we already have:",

                "6) Protection of existing water rights", 
                "The quickest and cheapest source of new water is to stretch our current supplies by conserving what we have. Californians have been at this for years in our cities, in our industries, on the farm, and in our homes. We have engaged in serious water conservation, yet more can and should be done everywhere.", 
                "There are many conservation strategies. One conservation strategy is to use devices that measure the moisture in the soil to provide real time monitoring of the exact amount of water needed for ideal growing conditions. These devices are connected to a computer that automatically turns on just the right amount of water. These systems are in use and conserve at least ten percent with a financial payback in less than one year. If they were deployed widely perhaps at least 1 percent of the 30 million acre feet of water consumed by agriculture could be saved each year (300,000 acre feet).", 
                "All of us are going to do a lot more water conservation, not just the agriculture community. The water conservation mandate set by the state is a 20 percent reduction per capita by 2020 which equals 1,600,000 acre feet. In a very real way conservation can create new water that was not previously available for use. To be on the conservative side, let us assume that just one quarter of the State's goal could be obtained in the next decade, thereby adding 400,000 acre feet of new water to our supplies each year.", 
                "Can you name the fifth biggest river on the west coast of the Western Hemisphere? It's the water that flows out of the sanitation plants in Southern California and is dumped into the Pacific Ocean.", 
                "Why would any sane government take water from the Sacramento River, pump it 500 miles south, lift it 5,000 feet in the air, clean it, use it once, clean it to a higher standard than the day it arrives in Southern California, then dump it in the ocean? California does just this as it discharges over 3.5 million acre feet of water to the ocean each year, much of which could be reused.", 
                "We need to think seriously about recycling, not just in Southern California, but everywhere. The State of California currently recycles approximately 650,000 acre feet of water each year and has set a water recycling goal of 1.5 million acre feet of new water in California by 2020, and 2.5 million acre feet by 2030. While achievable, WateReuse California estimates this goal cannot be achieved without State regulatory changes to expand the types of recycling available that rely on existing technologies.", 
                "Another option is desalination of the ocean. This is feasible and used extensively throughout the world, however it is not a viable option for all communities. It costs about 40 percent more to desalinate sea water than to recycle water using current technology. However, technological advances are being pursued for both recycling and desalination that could lower the costs of both.", 
                "In the next ten years, conservation and recycling in California can create approximately 2.2 million acre feet of new water to use each year, and that can increase to 3.2 million acre feet in twenty years. This is new water that is not available today because it is wasted or pumped out to sea. It can be developed at a reasonable cost when compared to all other alternatives that might be out there. Conservation and recycling are steps one and two in a comprehensive water program for California.", 
                "Water storage south of the Delta is possible and necessary. The capacity of the great Delta pumps near Tracy is 15,000 cubic feet per second. They are designed to meet maximum demand south of the Delta. They do not operate year round, only when there is sufficient water in the Delta, when threatened fish are not near the pumps, and when there is agricultural and urban demand south of the Tracy pumps. There is very limited water storage capacity south of the Delta. We must build more. San Luis and Los Vaqueros reservoirs could be expanded. New dams could be built at Los Banos Grandes, Temperance Flats, and numerous smaller off stream sites throughout the San Joaquin Valley. There are extensive and numerous aquifers throughout the San Joaquin Valley that may prove suitable to store additional water that would be used in a conjunctive water management system. With these water storage facilities in place and a smaller cross Delta facility operating year round, the need for havoc causing, excessive pumping in the Delta could be avoided.", 
                "When coupled with recycling, the underground aquifers in Southern California are another key to our water future. The underground aquifers of the Santa Ana River in Orange County, the San Fernando Basin, Chino Basin, San Bernardino, San Gabriel Basin, and others have a combined capacity larger than Shasta Reservoir, the largest man made reservoir in the state. Today, some recycled water is put into the underground water basins to be stored for those inevitably dry years. When needed, it is pumped out, used, cleaned and returned to storage. On a larger scale this recycling system could create as much as 2.5 million acre feet of new water, and thereby reduce the need for shifting Colorado River supplies and imports from the Sacramento River.", 
                "Surface and underground storage should be used in a conjunctive water management program. Use the rivers when there is lots of water and use the reservoirs when there is little. Another way to describe this strategy is ``big gulp'' and ``little sips.'' When there are low flows in the Delta the system would take a little sip. When there is excessive water in the Delta, the system would take a big gulp, but there must be some place to put that water when the big gulp is taken. Therefore, the surface and sub-surface reservoirs south of the Delta become an essential element in a California water plan.", 
                "Water storage north of the Delta is also important, and three proposals are on the books today. An off stream reservoir at Sites, located west of Williams, has great promise for storage and for creating greater flexibility in managing the Sacramento River for salmon runs, water demand, and Delta outflow. This reservoir can deliver 500,000 acre feet of annual yield and the additional flexibility that it offers can under some scenarios save another 500,000 acre feet of water that would otherwise be released into the river systems. Raising Shasta Dam is also possible, as is better conjunctive management of the many aquifers in the Sacramento Valley. State and federal agencies have already commenced studies for these projects. A quick completion of these studies is essential.", 
                "The current plan for the California Water Fix (BDCP) is a dual use facility with the main focus on the twin tunnels with a capacity of 15,000 cubic feet per second, and the continued use of the Delta channels for moving water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers to the Tracy pumps. This dual use system adds another layer of risk to the eco-system and agricultural economy of the Delta with the potential for the massive tunnels to suck the Delta dry from the north and from the south with the thirsty pumps. In scale, the cost and destructive potential of this project will rival the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China. The twin tunnel proposal is a large scale, destructive project that does not create one gallon of new water for a thirsty California.", 
                "The location of the intakes for the twin tunnels is in the heart of the rich farm lands of the northern Delta, near the small community of Courtland. Thousands of acres of valuable farmland essential to California agriculture production will be destroyed during construction of the project, and, following completion, a vast industrial zone of pumping stations, fish screens, reservoirs, and electrical stations will impede on one of California's great agricultural regions. Along the forty mile route of the twin tunnels the construction process will produce a total of 22 million cubic yards of tunnel muck. This combination of soil and conditioning agents will have to be stored and managed and the latest draft of the plan calls for storage areas along the tunnel ranging in size from 100 to 570 acres. The amount of muck extracted would be enough to cover 100 football fields to a height of roughly 100 feet, and in the end will destroy close to 1600 acres of farm land while disrupting domestic and agricultural water wells.", 
                "Go forward carefully; start small; use science to evaluate each step; then proceed to the next step. Remember the Delta is a unique and precious environmental asset. We must take care of it. A narrowly focused plumbing system like the California Water Fix/BDCP will not achieve progress in creating a water supply sufficient for California's future. We must pursue a holistic, comprehensive approach that will achieve a bigger bang for our buck.", 
                "First, reduce demand on the Delta with steps one, two and three: water conservation, recycling, and strategic use of storage facilities. Use the ``Big Gulp, Little Sip'' pumping strategy. Move forward with the flood plain and fresh and saltwater marsh habitat improvements. Repair and improve the key Delta levees. Evaluate the effect on the Delta as these projects come on line.", 
                "Then, and only if necessary, proceed with a conveyance system that is much smaller and with a reduced capacity to destroy.", 
                "A much smaller facility with a capacity of no more than 3,000 cubic feet per second could be built to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. With the normal minimum flows in the Sacramento River above 15,000 cfs, a small 3,000 cfs facility could operate at least 300 days in most years, delivering approximately two million acre feet of water south to the pumps at Tracy where it would be pumped south to the new and expanded storage facilities.", 
                "There are several alternative ways to build this smaller system. One alternative is found with a careful look at the Delta map which reveals that two thirds of this Delta friendly system is already built. Two miles from the State Capital is the Port of Sacramento and the shipping channel that ends 25 miles south near Rio Vista. From there it is thirteen miles to existing channels and the Tracy pumps. The Federal Government already owns the land along the river where an intake and fish screen could be built, allowing 3000 cfs of Sacramento River water to enter the channel and flow south to a shipping lock at the southern end of the channel. Then, pumps could deliver the water into a short 12-mile pipe beneath the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and into the existing Delta channels that lead to the Tracy Pumps. The threatened Delta fish could be protected by sealing the channel from the Delta. Such a smaller facility is less costly than two 40-foot diameter, 40-mile long tunnels that devastate large swaths of the Delta and put the entire Delta at risk.", 
                "It is correct that this smaller facility like the twin tunnels is insufficient to quench the thirst of the Southern water contractors. This is where the southern reservoirs and the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp'' strategy comes into play. In normal water years there is sufficient water in the Delta to allow the pumps to take a big gulp of two million acre feet of water. This amount together with the two million acre feet delivered through the 3,000 cfs facility and the new water developed from conservation and recycling efforts could add up to six million acre feet. This plan would create far more new water than will ever be available with the current California Water Fix (BDCP) plan, which in its current state creates nothing new, except new destruction.", 
                "This small 3,000 cfs proposal and the current twin tunnel proposal envision the continued use of the existing Delta levee system as water conveyance channels for the delivery of water to the big pumps at Tracy. However, the California Water Fix (BDCP) has neither a plan nor funding for the maintenance of the levees that are crucial for their proposed water conveyance system. The Delta levees must be upgraded and maintained if water is to be transported through the Delta and if the Delta agriculture, infrastructure, ecology and people are to be protected.", 
                "No sane homeowner would go fifty years without maintaining their plumbing system. For more than fifty years, the Bureau of Reclamation and the California Department of Water Resources have used the Delta levees as a plumbing system to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. Yet, they have spent virtually no money maintaining these critical levees, the failure of which could shut down water deliveries for an extended period of time. The Federal and State agencies have relied upon the local reclamation agencies to do the repairs, literally giving the exporters a free ride. When a levee does give way and an island is flooded, it is the local agency and Federal and State governments that foot the bill to repair the levees, often at a much greater cost than would have been necessary with basic maintenance.", 
                "Legislation is necessary to require that the Federal and State water contractors, who have for years and will continue for even more years depended upon the Delta levees for the delivery of water to their fields and cities, pay a part of the levee maintenance cost.", 
                "The California Water Fix (BDCP) envisions restoring flood plains and the salt and freshwater marsh habitat of the Delta in an effort to restore the fisheries. However, a series of questions are raised: where to do it, how much to do, what type, at what cost and who is to pay for the restoration? Those who have created the ecological problem should pay for the restoration of the problem. All this will require careful attention to science, and a careful balance between competing goals. Current science indicates that no amount of habitat restoration can compensate for the damage done to fish from excessive water exports.", 
                "The California Water Fix (BDCP) and any other proposal must be based and driven by quality science that measures and informs decisions. California and federal law require that the Delta aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems be protected. We must do so, not just because the laws demand it, but because our status as human beings on this planet demands that we pay attention and protect precious and rare ecosystems. Also, healthy ecosystems provide a valuable asset to our communities because healthy ecosystems help to ensure we have healthy water. If we let the ecosystems fall by the wayside, our water will get dirtier making it increasingly difficult and costly to clean it up enough to use. For all of these reasons, we must let science govern.", 
                "The California Water Fix (BDCP) anticipates 50-year permits from state and federal agencies to allow incidental takes of endangered fish species. Once granted, the water exporters will have assurances that the project can take covered species and pump Delta water despite changes in the environment. To date, the California Water Fix (BDCP) has not built in flexibility to address the inevitable changes that will occur and the damage that could be done if the plan does not account for climate change.", 
                "We must also use science to understand our river basins in the age of climate change. Dams on California Rivers serve multiple purposes of water storage, flood protection, electric power generation, recreation, and environmental river flows. Current dam operations on California Rivers place flood protection as the first priority followed by water storage. The decisions to release water to create greater flood storage are based on the average river flows compiled from the last 60 years. Climate change and resulting river flow change is certain and one can only imagine how rare it will be for the historic average to actually occur.", 
                "We have the technology today to better understand what is happening, in real time, in every river basin in this state. Satellites and unmanned aircraft using infrared and ground sensing radar, together with terrestrial stations collecting soil conditions, snow temperature and moisture content coupled with telemetry will soon be deployed in the American River basin. Collecting this data and using it in real time to predict river flows allows for better operation of the dams so that additional flood storage capacity could be available by lowering the reservoir ahead of the storm or keeping water in the reservoir if a major storm is heading for a different river basin or if it is a cold snow storm. Using the best science can simultaneously deliver increased flood protection and greater water storage.", 
                "Soon after gold was discovered in California, the miners discovered that water could be used to separate gold from gravel and soon after, the right to the water flowing in the rivers became as valuable as the gold. Today, water is California's gold. The classic water war in California is usually about one group attempting to take another group's water. It is reasonable to view the current twin tunnels conflict in this way: southern exporters taking water belonging to northern water right holders and water necessary for the aquatic river environment. Any water plan that ignores the prior and existing water rights is destined to be embroiled in a vicious and contracted water war. If a project is to be built, then existing rights must be honored.", 
                "California must develop a comprehensive water program. The current California Water Fix (BDCP) is an outdated and destructive plumbing system. It does not create any new water. It does not provide the water and the ecological protection the Golden State must have. California and the federal government must set aside the big, expensive, destructive plumbing plan and immediately move forward with a comprehensive program that includes:", 
                "1) Conservation,", 
                "2) Recycling,", 
                "3) The creation of new storage systems,",

                "6) Protection of existing water rights", 
                "California is once again embroiled in a water war. The California Water Fix/BDCP is not a comprehensive plan; it is a plumbing system that seeks to extract water from one part of the state and deliver it to another part. If history is any indication, water wars are expensive and fruitless. Only by embracing a comprehensive plan that creates new water for the entire state can we avoid gridlock and a water war. This paper presents a plan that emphasizes using the best available science and a portfolio of water projects to create a positive solution to the water challenge facing California. It's time to move forward and ensure a reliable water supply for the entire state.", 
                "Don't be fooled. The dreaded twin tunnels through the heart of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta did not die. The governor's new ``California Water Fix'' plan is the same destructive twin tunnel $17 billion boondoggle, just without the fig leaf cover of habitat restoration. Not one gallon of new water supply is created for our thirsty state. California water needs can be met with a comprehensive program that over the next 10 years can create more than 5 million acre-feet of new water at a cost no greater than the twin tunnels. Here are the keys to our water future: 1. Conservation 2. Recycling/desalinization 3. Creation of new surface and aquifer storage 4. Science-driven process 5. Fixing the Delta--right-sized conveyance, levee improvements and habitat restoration Go forward carefully; start small; use science to evaluate each step; then proceed to the next step. The Delta is a unique and precious environmental asset. First, reduce demand on the Delta with water conservation, recycling and desalinization, and strategic use of surface and aquifer storage. Move forward with habitat improvements for the floodplain and fresh and saltwater marshes. Repair and improve the key Delta levees. Evaluate the effect on the Delta as these projects come online. Then, and only if necessary, proceed with a conveyance system that is much smaller and with a reduced capacity to destroy. A much smaller facility with a capacity of no more than 3,000 cubic feet per second could be built to deliver water from the Sacramento River to the Tracy pumps. With the normal minimum flows in the Sacramento River above 15,000 cubic feet per second, a 3,000-cfs facility could operate at least 300 days in most years, delivering about 2 million acre feet of water to the pumps at Tracy and on south to new and expanded storage facilities. Half of this Delta-friendly system is already built. Two miles from the state Capitol is the Port of Sacramento. A fish screen could be built at the existing opening on the Sacramento River, allowing 3,000 cubic feet per second of Sacramento River water to enter the deep water channel and flow 25 miles south to a shipping lock at the southern end of the channel. Then, pumps could deliver the water into a 12- mile pipe beneath the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and into a new aqueduct alongside the Old River channel that leads to the Tracy pumps. An alternative route could take the water out at the southern end of the shipping channel, delivering it into an aqueduct around the town of Rio Vista, across the Sacramento River at Sherman Island and through Contra Costa County to the Tracy pumps. This route would intersect six vital San Francisco Bay aqueducts, thus creating a safety system for 8 million Bay residents. The ``Little Sip, Big Gulp'' strategy completes the program to meet California's future water needs. In normal water years, there is sufficient water in the Delta to allow the pumps to take a ``big gulp'' of 2 million acre-feet of water. This amount together with the 2 million acre-feet delivered through the 3,000-cfs facility would meet the annual water demand south of the Delta. The new water developed from surface and underground storage, conservation, and recycling and desalinization efforts could add up to 5 million acre-feet, and together with an eco-friendly Delta solution would be enough to serve the future needs of a thriving California.

Over this time, he has been a tireless--some might even say relentless--leader for the Contra Costa Water District, making significant contributions not only at the local and regional level but to statewide and national water policy as well.", 
                "He has worked throughout his tenure to improve our region's drinking water quality, to secure a sustainable water supply, and to restore and protect the Bay-Delta ecosystem. I am pleased to be able to say that I have worked with him on many of his successes, and as some of my colleagues know, he can be a formidable adversary as well.", 
                "Although nothing comes easily in California water, Mr. Bishop has succeeded in putting Contra Costa Water District at the forefront of responsible and sustainable water management in the State. Under his direction, the Los Vaqueros Reservoir Project was the first major reservoir to be permitted and constructed in California in more than a decade, and the water district's ongoing reservoir expansion project, intake relocation, and screening efforts will not only improve Contra Costa's water supply but provide important statewide economic and environmental benefits as well.", 
                "A registered civil engineer, Wally Bishop has been honored many times by his profession and by the larger water and engineering communities. In addition to the awards presented to Contra Costa Water District under his leadership, he has personally been honored with the American Society of Civil Engineer's Award for Achievement in Environmental Engineering/Government Service and the American Public Works Association's Charles Nichols Award for Leadership and Innovative Management.", 
                "He has also served with distinction in national leadership roles, including as the chair of the Water Research Foundation and on the board of directors of the American Water Works Association, and he has been appointed to two terms on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Drinking Water Advisory Council.", 
                "Thanks in large part to Wally Bishop's leadership, the Contra Costa Water District is today in an excellent position to face the challenges of the 21st century. This is no accident: He is one of the true innovators and strategic thinkers in California water matters, and he and his staff have worked tirelessly throughout his tenure.",

The association celebrates its 40th anniversary at its annual summer conference and meeting July 20 to 23 in San Francisco. This year's conference, ``Sustainable Resource Management--Lessons from Clean Water's Past and Present,'' will surely inspire new solutions and innovative ideas to improve our country's water quality and protect the health of our children and families.", 
                "Established in 1970 by a group of individuals representing 22 large municipal sewerage agencies, NACWA now represents over 300 of the Nation's publicly owned wastewater utilities. NACWA grew up alongside the landmark Clean Water Act of 1972, which has been enormously successful at reducing pollution into our Nation's waterways. The 22 founding agencies of NACWA united behind a related mission: to secure investment in municipal wastewater treatment and improve water quality. As NACWA continued to grow and diversify, they have worked to promote watershed management and the health of our ecosystems.", 
                "Today, NACWA has an active membership of publicly owned treatment agencies stretching from coast to coast. NACWA provides its members with educational resources, community building, networking opportunities, and a forum for sharing best practices and building consensus on water policy.", 
                "I am so pleased to acknowledge NACWA's long and distinguished record of environmental advocacy. Clean, safe drinking water is essential to all of us. The association has been a leader on a range of issues affecting our water supply. Over the course of my career in the Senate, I have had the pleasure of working with NACWA on important legislation including the Water Infrastructure Financing Act and the Water Resources Development Act.", 
                "In 2008, I was honored to receive NACWA's Legislative Leadership Award for my efforts on the Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, of 2007. This historic legislation is of critical importance to our Nation's water quality and economy. WRDA 2007 garnered broad support on both sides of the aisle, and I am again working with my colleagues to pass a WRDA bill that will build on the important progress we made in WRDA 2007, continue investment in vital water resources projects, and create jobs rebuilding the Nation's aging water infrastructure.", 
                "I commend the members and staff of NACWA for their dedication and support for policies that advance clean water and a healthy, sustainable environment. Their efforts have certainly had a positive impact on our Nation's environmental policy and water quality. I look forward to working with NACWA to improve our Nation's water quality, ecosystems and infrastructure for years to come by supporting legislation that protects our Nation's waterways and water supply. Together, we can ensure clean water for future generations. Please join me in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. "

                "While Tom rose to the height of California water politics as General Manager of the Kern County Water Agency, KCWA, he was proud of his Oildale beginnings and never let anyone forget that. After graduating from North High School in 1963, he served for two years in the United States Army and married his sweetheart, Karen. Tom and Karen moved back to Bakersfield in 1970, and he quickly earned degrees from Bakersfield College and California State University, Bakersfield. Tom then received a full scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh, where he received a Master's Degree in water supply and pollution.", 
                "Back in Bakersfield, Tom began his career with KCWA in 1974. During this time, he honed his understanding and knowledge of California water contract law, as well as the ins and outs of Kern County and California water policy. He left KCWA in 1978 and went to work for the late local farmer and entrepreneur George Nickel, where he learned a great deal about Kern River water rights. He later returned to KCWA and became General Manager in 1990, serving in this capacity for 14 years.", 
                "As General Manager, Tom was at the center of California water politics, fighting tirelessly for Kern County residents and farmers to ensure our local communities received the water they needed and were entitled to. Recognized as a skilled and shrewd negotiator, Tom could wade through complex water problems to achieve collaborative, win-win solutions, all the while improving water supply reliability for Kern County.", 
                "One of Tom's greatest achievements and lasting legacies was the Monterey Agreement, which he helped negotiate with the California Department of Water Resources and other State Water Project contractors. This averted an agricultural disaster in Kern County by preventing tens of thousands of acres of farmland from being fallowed because of lack of water. He also was at the table and worked on the historic 1994 Bay Delta Accord, which provided an agreement among water agencies and environmentalists, leading to the CalFed Record of Decision by the United States Department of the Interior.", 
                "To provide more water reliability and supply stability, Tom was the driving force behind the Pioneer Project, a 2,253-acre groundwater recharge and water banking project located in Kern County, which KCWA operates to this day. This project was deservedly renamed the ``Thomas N. Clark Recharge and Banking Project'' in 2010. His leadership over the years helped KCWA navigate through ``wet'' and ``dry'' years, and the benefits of that leadership are still seen throughout the community and at all levels of government.", 
                "Tom is survived by his wife, Karen, his children, Krista and Jeff, and his grandchild, Henry. I will miss Tom's great sense of humor and barbequing, but I know he will be fondly remembered as a strong leader who was a passionate advocate for Kern County water and respected by many."

                "Sig was born to Spanish immigrant parents, as the second of eleven children. His mother worked in a cigarette factory in San Francisco and his father was an agricultural laborer. In 1942, Sig moved to Gilroy because of his involvement in agriculture. For 20 years, Sig owned a melon-packing operation with two of his brothers and a 600-acre farm to the south of Los Banos.", 
                "Sig entered public service over 55 years ago when one of his tractors broke down. He went to repair his tractor and the owner of the shop was on the Gilroy City Council. The councilmember proceeded to encourage Sig to join him on the council. Sig served for five years as a councilman and another five years as the mayor. He then served 16 years on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. As a county supervisor, Sig advocated for the merger of the Santa Clara County Flood Control and Water District with the Santa Clara Valley Water Conservation District to better address floor management and water importation. In all his years of public service, he tried to never leave his office without returning every phone call.", 
                "In 1980, Sig was appointed as an at-large director to the water district board. He was a key player in the 1987 merger of the Gavilan Water District in South County with the Santa Clara Valley Water District, which allowed for full integration of all the county's reservoirs and groundwater facilities. Sig was a charter board member in the 1992 development of the San Luis and Delta-Mendota Water Authority, a joint organization of 32 water and irrigation agencies that contract with the US Bureau of Reclamation for water from the Central Valley Project. He was also instrumental in water importation into Santa Clara County with the county Board of Supervisors, South Bay Aqueduct, water district board, and the San Felipe project. As the longest serving member of the water district's board of directors, Sig guided the agency on pressing water quality problems, steered the valley through both floods in the 1980s, and helped it survive the 1987-1992 drought.", 
                "Sig has served as a board member of HOPE Rehabilitation, Wheeler Hospital Foundation, and the Gilroy Elks Club. As a passionate advocate for water and flood control issues, he has been an active member of national, state, and local water resource organizations, including the Agricultural Water Advisory Committee, Central valley Project Authority, Pajaro River Watershed Flood Prevention Authority, San Luis & Delta Mendota Water Authority Board and Finance Committee, Uvas/Llagas Flood Control and Watershed Advisory Committee, Santa Clara Valley Water Commission, Santa Clara Valley Water District Board Ad Hoc Audit Committee, and the South County Regional Wastewater Authority.", 
                "In recognition of his service and contributions, Sig was inducted into the Gilroy Hall of Fame in 1991. A building in San Martin is named after Sig. He also has a 10-mile portion of state Highway Route 101, the Sig Sanchez Freeway, named in honor of his 12-year effort to lobby various government agencies to build the highway.", 
                "Sig is being honored as the Gilroy Chamber of Commerce's 2013 Man of the Year on February 9. I join in honoring his decades of contribution and service to the betterment of our society. The community is very fortunate to have benefited from his dedication, commitment, and advocacy. He has left his mark in the community and I know he will continue to play a positive role in the years to come."

So the inconvenient truth for the folks on the left is that their 40 years of policies have resulted in people running out of water.",

                "Now there seems to be this misunderstanding about how the system works. L.A., Hollywood, San Francisco, it is a desert. They don't have water.

They ignore all environmental rules, but they make our people who live in the San Joaquin Valley live by the rules that they don't want to live by. That is the reality.",

So you can see when we had a drought in 1997 and 1991 and 2009, these were the allotments at those times. Last year, we actually didn't have a real bad drought. Look at the allocation. So the system simply isn't being used. All the aqueducts and all the dams that were constructed--led by Democrats, of all people, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy.",

                "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exciting event that took place in my district this past week on April 10, 2015, by the Padre Dam Municipal Water District. The Grand Opening of the Padre Dam Advanced Water Purification Demonstration Pilot Plant in Santee, California is an important and critical step in the overall effort by San Diego County to become more water independent as a region and maintain the very best in our water management practices. We all know that California is currently in the midst of a severe multi-year drought, but ensuring our communities can rely on being provided with clean and healthy water has been the mission of Padre Dam for many decades. In fact, on this same day in 1962, founding General Manager of Padre Dam Ray Stoyer wrote to President Kennedy complimenting him on his commitment to the science of water management innovation and requesting his assistance in a groundbreaking water reclamation study and project at Padre Dam. President Kennedy supported the District's reclamation efforts and today the appropriately named Ray Stoyer Water Recycling Facility treats and recycles more than two million gallons of water per day. Over the years, these efforts have been recognized by the California Water Environment Association, which awarded this facility its ``California Plant of the Year'' designation in 2005, as well as naming it ``San Diego Plant of the Year'' multiple times in 1977, 1978, 1981, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2010. I am pleased to see that this proud tradition is being carried on with Padre Dam's most recent effort in its Advanced Water Purification Demonstration Pilot Plant. Funded through a $3 million state grant, this innovative project will test the feasibility of creating a new source of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 acre feet of purified water for East San Diego County. If successful, this project has the potential to provide up to 20% of our current drinking water demand via a locally-controlled, independent, drought-proof and environmentally sound water supply, thereby reducing our dependency on outside sources of imported water. California's current drought conditions, coupled with San Diego's historical reliance on imported water, mandate that we pursue every alternative that will lead to the San Diego region expanding its resource portfolio and utilize an ``all the above'' approach to water management. This includes traditional efforts such as conservation and reservoir and aquifer storage, as well as taking advantage of new technologies and science in the areas of desalination and reclamation projects like the one developed by Padre Dam which we are today recognizing. My colleagues, I ask that you join me in congratulating Padre Dam Municipal Water District for its forward-thinking vision and willingness to pursue new ideas on an old, but important, problem. Everyone at the District, from leadership to all members of staff, is making a direct positive impact in our community and I am confident that your investment will prove to be valuable in helping us reach both our short and long-term water management goals."

They have substituted conservation for desperately needed storage, and now that we face drought, we find that our few reservoirs are empty, and our conservation options are already exhausted.", 
                "Worse, in the first years of this drought, 1.6 million acre-feet of water was dumped into the Pacific Ocean for the care and amusement of the delta smelt. Mr. Chairman, 800,000 acre-feet--enough for 4 million Californians--was deliberately drained from our now empty reservoirs just several months ago, knowing that that water was desperately needed to support the threatened human population. Part of that water was taken from Central Valley farmers, who now face economic extinction. This bill corrects these tragic policies.", 
                "It is true, we cannot make it rain, but we can take measures to stop this lunacy, increase storage capacity, reinforce existing water rights, and ensure that we never again must face a crisis of this magnitude.", 
                "This bill allows for the expansion of Lake McClure by 70,000 acre-feet. It gives local water agencies the ability to store additional water at New Melones. It sets deadlines for additional storage. It authorizes local water districts to partner with the Federal Government to expedite expansion of existing reservoirs and construction of new ones, and it reverses the policies that put the delta smelt ahead of the needs of thousands of farmworkers and millions of consumers.", 
                "Now, the people responsible for these policies say that this steals water from northern California. It does not. This is only water that would otherwise be lost to the Pacific Ocean. This bill restores the bipartisan Bay Delta Accord that guarantees the delta the water that it needs and grants a portion of any excess to the Central Valley. This historic accord was broken when Central Valley water was expropriated for the delta smelt. This bill restores that accord while making provisions to increase the overall supply.", 
                "The other outlandish charge is that this measure overrides State water rights. It does exactly the opposite. It specifically protects State water rights against infringement by any bureaucracy--local, State, or Federal.", 
                "We have listened to the environmental left for 40 years, and this is where it has gotten us. It is time to reject these voices and return to the commonsense and proven policies of abundance that produced the prosperity that we once enjoyed."

                "In short, this bill is another blatant water grab from northern California.", 
                "Mr. Chairman, my amendment will protect senior water rights holders in northern California and assure we are all in this together in California. We should not pit one against another.", 
                "Again, this bill will not help alleviate the drought. Even if we pumped as much water south as possible, Central Valley farmers still wouldn't have enough. That is because a lack of pumping is not the problem. The problem is a lack of rain and snow. There is no more water to pump.", 
                "Northern California is in severe drought. This bill does not solve California's drought. It only further divides our State.", 
                "Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "The OCSD services approximately 2.5 million people, 21 cities and has two operating facilities that treat wastewater from residential, commercial and industrial sources. Through innovative technologies, the OCSD has served as a leader and model for communities around the world as they battle to protect public health and the environment from the harms of untreated wastewater.", 
                "However, the OCSD does not just simply treat wastewater. In fact, by utilizing all practical and effective means, the OCSD is producing an average of 10,000 kilowatts of electricity per day, monitoring the water quality of local beaches, and recycling 268,000 tons of biosolids per year. Yet, these are only the secondary benefits of its highest achievement.", 
                "In a joint venture with the Orange County Water District, the OCSD facilitated the creation of the world's largest water purification system, the Orange County Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS). Using a three-step advanced treatment process, the GWRS purifies 70 million gallons of high quality potable water per day that would otherwise be unusable. This is the equivalent to the daily water use of 600,000 people. The GWRS has since received more than 35 awards, including the Stockholm Industry Water Award, which is the highest international honor bestowed upon water projects, and the 2014 U.S. Water Prize Award from the U.S. Water Alliance.", 
                "I am proud of the work, dedication, and accomplishments of the Orange County Sanitation District over the past 60 years and wish them further success as they continue to lead the world in effective wastewater collection, treatment and recycling."

                "Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a retiring leader of the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, Patrick Milligan. Patrick Milligan was born in San Bernardino in 1937. His family started one of the original citrus farms in Rialto. He fondly recalls memories of growing up in Rialto during a time when he and his friends could walk through vacant land shooting bb guns. In 1955, he graduated with honors from San Bernardino High School and later graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law. He returned to his hometown and began practicing trial law in 1961, starting a law firm in San Bernardino where he continues to practice law. Pat is married to Jean Miller Milligan and has four children, two of whom have followed in his footsteps as attorneys.", 
                "In 1964, at the age of 28, Pat was elected to the Board of Directors for the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (Valley District). He has served on the Board for over 41 years and has served as President of the Board for 19 of those years, almost half of his tenure. When Pat was elected, Valley District was only 10 years old. So, Pat has been involved in building this new agency from the ground up. He ``hit the ground running'' helping Valley District settle two lawsuits with Orange County Water District and Western Municipal Water District, respectively. The settlements fairly divide water resources providing the downstream agencies with the guaranteed amounts they desired while providing the upstream, Valley District service area, the flexibility they desired. The resulting court judgments are still used to this day to manage water resources. To help reduce the possibility of costly lawsuits in the future by providing a forum where water issues could be discussed, Valley District along with Orange County Water District, Chino Basin Municipal Water District (now Inland Empire Utilities Agency), and Western Municipal Water District formed the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority.", 
                "Pat was also instrumental in settling a 40-year legal dispute that involved both the Department of Water Resources and Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC). He directed the effort to negotiate with MWDSC which led to a cooperative agreement. Under that agreement, MWDSC has purchased some of Valley District's unused imported water from the State Water Project resulting in substantial revenues used to build facilities and purchase water for storage locally. The agreement also benefited MWDSC when their partially completed Inland Feeder Pipeline was connected to Valley District's Foothill Pipeline allowing MWDSC to fill their newly constructed Diamond Valley Reservoir before their pipeline was complete.", 
                "When Pat took office, Valley District had a contract with the State of California to receive up to 98,000 acre-feet of water from the State Water Project but Valley District had no facilities in place to distribute the water. Under his leadership, Valley District built a regional pipeline system that began with the 84,000 foot long, 6.5 foot diameter Foothill Pipeline. The system now spans from Rialto in the west to Yucaipa in the east. To save money, these facilities were built in partnership with other water agencies. Pat shepherded this ambitious project through good and bad economic times, and never lost the vision to complete these regional facilities. Later, Valley District had the foresight to purchase an additional 4,600 acre-feet of entitlement water raising the total annual amount to 102,600 acre-feet. Pat was the innovator and force behind using ``Super Wells'' to lower high groundwater conditions in South San Bernardino to help prevent liquefaction, a new term at that time, during earthquakes. The super wells and accompanying pipeline, known as the Baseline Feeder, pumped the nuisance high groundwater to meet needs in Rialto. On the east end of the valley, additional facilities were added that enabled the transport of local storm water. These facilities, in combination with other local facilities, were used in a creative arrangement to meet supplemental water needs in the Yucaipa area without construction of a pipeline to Yucaipa. The agreement, known as the ``Exchange Plan'', enabled Mill Creek water to be delivered to Yucaipa in exchange for State Water Project (SWP) water.", 
                "Pat has always looked out for the Valley in which he grew up. In the early 1970's the United States Army Corps of Engineers unveiled an ambitious flood control plan on the Santa Ana River that included the proposed Mentone Dam that would capture both the Santa Ana River and Mill Creek. While the Mentone Dam made sense as a flood control facility, it did not make sense to people that lived in the valley. The dam would have created an eyesore on the east end of the valley and covered over most of the community of East Highland! Valley District took the lead in encouraging alternate proposals and in 1986, the Army Corps agreed to an alterative that moved the dam into the foothills where it stands today. Under Pat's leadership, the Seven Oaks Dam is being used not only for flood control but also for water supply. Valley District, on behalf of water customers throughout the valley, partnered with the Western Municipal Water District and secured Water Right Permits to capture the newly detained water made available by the construction of the Dam. The capture of this water, which would have historically flowed into the Pacific Ocean, will save the people of the valley hundreds of millions of dollars.", 
                "Pat has always understood the value of the investment in the State Water Project. When that value was threatened by the Department of Water Resources and other State Water Contractors, Pat directed litigation to protect the District's contract right to sell any unused imported water at a fair price. Valley District prevailed and the resulting revenue has been used over the years to help fund regional facilities, reducing local costs.", 
                "Pat has always believed in good planning backed by solid science. Valley District has been a leader in studying the valley's resources to determine the opportunities and constraints. Through a relationship with the United States Geological Survey that has lasted decades, a groundwater flow model was produced which has proven invaluable to analyze water management scenarios and new projects. This model continues to be enhanced and is used every year to develop a management plan for the valley.", 
                "This year, Pat announced that he would be retiring from the Valley District Board. His vision and leadership will be dearly missed by both the Board and the Staff. I commend Pat for his years of leadership and service and wish him all the best."

                "Mr. Speaker, California is suffering its worst water crisis in modern history. This is a 1 in 500-year drought. For the third year in a row, dry weather conditions and drought-like conditions are hurting so many families in California--farmers, small businesses. If you need to see how bad things have gotten, look at Folsom Lake in my district. It is dry. Over 500,000 residents in my community rely on Folsom Lake as the source of its water. This is how bad it has gotten.", 
                "We are doing everything we can to conserve water, but you can't take water when it doesn't exist, and that is why H.R. 3964 is such a bad bill. It is a bill that is taking what doesn't exist. It doesn't create any new water; it just tries to move water from one community to another, but it doesn't exist. You can't take water that is not there. In fact, let me show you how bad things have gotten.", 
                "The snowpack in California in the Sierras is the source of water for over 500 million Californians. It is what we rely on. It is our biggest reservoir.",

But we've got to do this together--not pitting one region against another, not pitting one community against another. We have to come up with creative solutions. We can't just look at today's challenge. We have got to do that. That is an immediate issue. But we have also got to start discussing the future of water in California, looking at issues like storage, looking at issues like water recycling, looking at creative solutions because it is dry.",

We are here today on these three pieces of legislation that would settle the water rights of six Native American nations in New Mexico and Arizona. The people on these reservations inhabit the same sacred lands as their fathers, their grandfathers, and many generations before. These three bills would provide them with the water that their ancestors were entitled to but never received.", 
                "We often take for granted the most basic of our resources, water. The people of the pueblos and the high country of Arizona never have. They understand the value of water and its importance in their cultures and well-being. Water is the lifeblood of these individuals, and when they were assigned reservations of land, their assumption was that they would also have access to the water they needed to survive. They were not, and hence for the last 140-plus years, these individual Americans have been fighting for the right to this most basic of resources, water. It is time today for us to do something about this for these six native nations.", 
                "Mr. Chairman, you mentioned Charlie Dorame in your statement as an example of the type of dedication that has been made for these water rights settlements and the subsequent legislation. Leaders in each tribe and pueblo have invested many decades in trying to acquire water rights that for generations came without legal restrictions but instead were part of their homeland.", 
                "For many years these tribes have been treated as second-class citizens of our great country, America. We have taken their lands. We have taken their resources, and we have even taken their water. But instead of complaining, these pueblos and tribes have worked with the Federal Government and the local governments to legally, and I might add very costly, attempt to acquire access to something that always has been part of their lives, water.", 
                "Members of these tribes across the country today continue to work to support their sovereign nations. They work with the States and work with the local partners who see the benefit of the settlement not just for the tribal communities but for the entire region.",

                "Mr. Speaker, I have brought with me these resolutions so we can understand that they have wide support, not only from the Native American areas but also from their neighbors and their friends within the area. Each of these organizations supports the settlement of Indian reserved water rights by negotiation or agreement. They realize in order to plan for the future and for their economy, we need to provide certainty to a basic human right, water.", 
                "These resolutions are consistent with the administration's views of supporting collaborative negotiations as an inherent responsibility to Federal trustees to Indian tribes and their members. Most importantly, we can not, we must not forget that we are talking about Americans, Native Americans, human beings. These tribes and pueblos have done everything that we have asked of them and have taken the long walk to walk with the Federal Government's legal restraints and now are in sight of securing for their people a basic human right, water.", 
                "After decades, these people have made huge efforts to play by the government rules to acquire rightful access to water that traditionally came with the land that they lived on. The price for these people has been high, the walk long and filled with many disappointments and many empty promises.", 
                "I ask that you support this legislation today. Support it because these Native Americans have followed all of the rules, procedures, and hurdles that our government has laid out. Support the legislation because it is the right thing to do and because it is supported by all local community and regional water managers; and, most importantly, because it is time to provide certainty to the tribes and the pueblos and the people of New Mexico and Arizona that we can do right by them. At the end of the day for this one precious resource, water, we can sit down and appreciate doing the right thing for them.",

Settlements should result in the least possible disruption of existing water uses and the economies based on those uses, while at the same time providing the affected tribes with the firm water supplies required to meet the long-term needs of the reservation inhabitants and to establish lasting tribal economies. 2. The achievement of these objectives requires federally funded water projects designed to ensure that all of the tribal water needs in the subject basin or watershed are met. 3. Appropriate participation of the Federal, State, local governmental and Tribal entities, and non-Indian water users in the settlement process is required for the success of any negotiated settlement. 4. Any water rights settlements that have been approved by the respective parties should be immediately and fully funded to implement their terms within the specified timeframes. The Federal Government must take advantage of existing funding authorizations, such as Title VI, Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and Health, of P.L. 110-293, by complying in a timely manner with Congressional mandates and budgeting funds, while continuing to explore and develop new creative solutions to fund Indian water rights settlements.",

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Western States Water Council reiterates its support for the policy of encouraging negotiated settlements of Indian water rights disputes as the best solution to a critical problem that affects almost all of the Western States; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Western States Water Council urges the Administration to support its stated policy in favor of Indian land and water settlements with a strong fiscal commitment for meaningful federal contributions to these settlements that recognizes the trust obligations of the United States government; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Congress should explore opportunities to provide funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake project construction related to settlements from revenues accruing to the Reclamation Fund, recognizing the existence of other legitimate needs that may be financed by these reserves. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that steps be taken to change current budgetary policy to ensure that any land or water settlement, once authorized by the Congress and approved by the President, will be funded without a corresponding offset to some other tribe or essential Interior Department program."

Since declaring a drought state of emergency on January 17th, state agencies have been working closely with federal, local, and municipal agencies and others, to respond quickly. We have taken unprecedented actions to deal with the crisis, including allocating zero water deliveries to water contractors from the State Water Project for the first time in the project's history. Last week, California also released a comprehensive plan for future water management, including storage, conservation, recycling, water transfers and other actions. H.R. 3964 is an unwelcome and divisive intrusion into California's efforts to manage this severe crisis. It would override state laws and protections, and mandate that certain water interests come out ahead of others. It falsely suggests the promise of water relief when that is simply not possible given the scarcity of water supplies. H.R. 3964 would interfere with our ability to respond effectively and flexibly to the current emergency, and would re-open old water wounds undermining years of progress toward reaching a collaborative long-term solution to our water needs. I urge you to oppose H.R. 3964. Sincerely, Edmund G. Brown, Jr.", 
                "Testimony of Anthony Willardson, Executive Director,Western States ", 
                "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, my name is Tony Willardson and I am the Executive Director of the Western States Water Council (WSWC). Our members are appointed by the Governors of eighteen western states. We are a nonpartisan government entity serving as an advisory body on water policy issues, and are very closely affiliated with the Western Governors' Association (WGA). We appreciate the opportunity to testify. Since H.R. 1837 was only recently introduced, the Council has not had an opportunity to adopt a specifically position on the legislation. However, I will address general principles related to federal-state relations that are useful in evaluating specific legislation--including H.R. 1837--and other actions addressing the serious water-related challenges facing the West and the Nation. During the Council's regular meetings next month, we will have an opportunity to more fully consider H.R. 1837 and will share any further comments thereafter. My testimony today is based specifically on a July 2010 Council policy position entitled, ``A Shared Vision for Water Planning and Policy,'' as well as a June 2006 WGA Water Report entitled, Water Needs and Strategies for a Sustainable Future, the 2008 WGA ``Next Steps'' Water Report, and ongoing policy discussions. Our 2010 position and the WGA Water Reports include a number of policy statements and recommendations related to federal programs and projects under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction, and which we would hope would be carefully considered as you evaluate H.R. 1837. With regard to provisions related to preemption of state law, the last paragraph of the Council's position related to A Shared Vision for Water Planning and Policy, states: ``. . . Nothing in any act of Congress should be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way to interfere with the laws of the respective States relating to: (a) water or watershed planning; (b) the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation or for municipal or any other purposes, or any vested right acquired therein; or (c) intending to affect or in any way to interfere with any interstate compact, decree or negotiated water rights agreement.'' This language was intentionally patterned after Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 (and similar Congressional directives). Any weakening of the deference to state water law as now expressed in Section 8 is of concern to the Council--including Section 202 of H.R. 1837. Provisions of this nature are inconsistent with the policy of cooperative federalism that has guided Reclamation Law for over a century, and are a threat to water right and water right administration in all the Western States. Recognizing that the ``future growth and prosperity of the western states depend upon the availability of adequate quantities of water of suitable quality,'' western governors created the Council in 1965 to address the need for an accurate and unbiased appraisal of present and future [water] requirements . . . and the most equitable means of providing for . . . such requirements. . . .'' On a west-wide regional level, the governors charged the Council ``. . . to accomplish effective cooperation among western states in planning for programs leading to integrated development by state, federal and other agencies of their water resources.'' Since its creation, the Council has served as a unified voice on behalf of western governors on water policy issues. Over the years, the Council has continually sought to develop a regional consensus on westwide water policy and planning issues, including many federal initiatives and legislation. The Council strives to collectively protect western states' interests in water, while at the same time serving to coordinate and facilitate efforts to improve western water management. With respect to the latter, the Council and eleven federal agencies have signed a Declaration of Cooperation creating what we call our Western Federal Agency Support Team (WestFAST), to increase collaboration on water issues of mutual concern. The Council has long recognized the importance of planning and policy in protecting and wisely managing our water resources for the benefit of our present and future generations, including our environment. The water development, management and protection challenges in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta System are not unique to California, but are reflected across the West and the Nation. Similarly, any solution to California's water and environmental needs (and compliance with state and federal mandates) affects the rest of the West to a greater or lesser extent. Perhaps this is best illustrated by California's physical dependence not only on the waters of northern and central California, but also the Colorado River Basin, shared by six other basin states. In recent years there has been a growing debate over national water policy and the need to elevate water issues as a national priority. The Council has been and continues to be actively involved in those policy discussions. The States are primarily responsible for allocating and administering rights to the use of water for myriad uses; and are in the best position to identify, evaluate and prioritize their needs. States and their political subdivisions share primary responsibility for planning and managing our Nation's water resources, both surface and ground water, both quantity and quality."

During his 30-year career in water, Steve worked diligently to bring diverse interests together and advance rational policies to address the State's water supply challenges. I can say without reservation that Steve was listened to and respected by all policy makers and stakeholders that he interacted with.", 
                "Steve Hall served as executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, ACWA, from 1993 until his retirement in 2007 due to Gehrig's disease. Steve brought a unique brand of leadership to water discussions when it was needed most. He forged relationships that transcended political and ideological circles. Known as a consensus builder, Steve's ability to bring people together was a determining factor in some of the key water successes of our time. Tim Quinn, current head of ACWA recently credited Steve's contributions with helping set the stage for the historic water legislation enacted last fall.", 
                "Steve Hall fought for solutions that work for farms, cities and the environment. He is credited with breaking a long-running gridlock and helping forge agreements that laid the groundwork for the landmark Bay-Delta Accord signed in 2004. He played a primary role in the so-called ``three-way'' negotiations that led to creation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program and paved the way for passage of Proposition 204 of 1996 and Proposition 13 of 2002, which provided funding for water management projects and programs statewide.", 
                "Steve Hall was always a strong advocate for science-based regulations that protect public health in a cost-effective manner. Steve was a leading advocate for strategies to address invasive species, reform the federal Endangered Species Act, and resolve water supply and ecosystem problems in the Delta. More recently, Steve led a year-long effort to develop ACWA's recent water policy document, ``No Time to Waste: A Blueprint for California Water.'' Among his numerous pursuits, Steve served on the boards of directors of the California Water Institute and the California Infrastructure Coalition. He also served on the State Reclamation Board, the UC Davis Land, Air and Water Advisory Committee and the California Bay-Delta Public Advisory Committee.", 
                "After retirement, Steve's motto became, ``As much as I can for as long as I can.'' Beyond his dedication to water issues, Steve cared deeply about his family, friends, his Lord and the people of California. Steve leaves behind his wife Pamela, two grown children, Jennifer and Adam, three grandchildren, his parents and a brother and sister. For all of us who knew him, he was an exceptional role model for how we should live; a life lived to its fullest. Steve will truly be missed by all. Here's to a truly great servant of the people."

                "Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Randy Poole who retired this month after serving more than 34 years in municipal water utilities, including 18 momentous years in leadership positions at the Sonoma County Water Agency (SCWA). Randy served first as SCWA's Chief Engineer beginning in 1991 and then in 1994 assumed the dual role of General Manager/Chief Engineer. The Sonoma County Water Agency provides water independent of the California Water System to over 600,000 residents in Mendocino, Sonoma and Marin Counties.", 
                "Many Members of this House would recognize Randy who spent many hours visiting our offices promoting the SCWA's water projects, as well as legislation for salmon preservation, wetlands restoration and renewable energy. Randy, with his slicked back hair and often dressed in black and purple was not the stereotypical water technocrat with scientific calculator in his pocket and flow charts in his briefcase. He is an individual who could manage the day to day functions of the SCWA while sculpting a big vision of its future.", 
                "Randy played an important role in garnering support for an $800 million Pacific Salmon restoration program involving the efforts of five states to restore the habitat of 16 salmonid species, including our native Russian River chinook and coho and steelhead trout. It was also Randy who spearheaded local efforts to complete a Biological Opinion on the effects of federal and local water projects on Russian River salmon and steelhead, a project that took 11 years and now must be implemented.", 
                "Under his leadership, the SCWA put biologists to work doing fish counts and measuring habitat; engineers designing wastewater irrigation systems; water efficiency experts looking at industrial water use; gardeners planting low water landscapes; wetlands experts restoring the Napa Salt Marsh; oceanographers studying ocean currents and wave energy; and energy consultants examining new pathways to clean and plentiful renewable energy.", 
                "His driving style has not come without controversy. A three year drought coupled with environmental restrictions that have constrained flows from the SCWA main reservoir, has sometimes brought the agency at odds with water contractors who have balked at reduced flows and conservation plans. When Randy began working at SCWA in 1991, one of his charges was to smooth the way for the Agency to obtain new water rights at Warm Springs Dam. Randy, however, recognized the new realities of expensive water projects and their environmental problems, and put the project on a back burner with a while emphasizing water conservation.", 
                "The Biological Opinion has also been criticized by downriver communities concerned about proposed lower summer flows and effects on the seal population at the mouth of the Russian River. SCWA has promised further studies and expanded river monitoring to iron out difficulties. Yet if the B.O. succeeds it will be a major step in restoring the river's once thriving fishery.", 
                "Randy recognized that climate change required the agency to do something about its own energy use--the highest in the county and he set SCWA on a zero carbon project, which will make it totally reliant on renewable energy by 2015. The Agency has kicked off the project with the installation of a 1 MGW solar system at its offices.", 
                "Randy was also instrumental in devising the nationally recognized Energy Independence Program, where home owners can weatherize their homes and install energy saving devices and solar panels at no upfront costs. Always thinking big, Randy has taken his energy ideas nationwide, forming a coalition of like-minded communities and promoting bills for local model projects and to lower consumer costs for home energy conservation and conversions to renewable energy.", 
                "Madam Speaker, I want to thank Randy Poole for his years of service to the customers of the Sonoma County Water Agency. I have been occasionally caught off balance by his whirlwind personality and grand approach to finding solutions, but I will miss his clear vision of the necessity of change in a changing world."
